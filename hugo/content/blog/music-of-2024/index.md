[Last year's post][music-2023] was fun to write and I like the journalling
component of this exercise. Let's see if I can continue and make it a routine.

## A Bumper Crop of Concerts

2024 was an exceptional year for great concerts. 27 of them to be precise! This
was a year where my appetite for live music was huge. I made efforts to ensure
that my life had space for these shows.

There were many highlights:

* **Dan Mangen**, **Mother Mother**, **Great Lake Swimmers**: A noteworthy
  contingent of Canadian bands I have fond memories of getting into when I was
  working at [CBC Radio 3][cbcr3].
* **Yard Act** - This was such an energetic and entertaining performance.
* **Florigin** - You may notice I saw this band multiple times. That's because
  my friend, Pip, is the drummer! It's a joy to see them play live and gain more
  and more experience. [Check them out!][florigin]
* **Air** - This was the band that first got me into music with a touch of
  electronic in it. They played in a beautiful outdoor venue that amplified the
  experience.
* **The Nits** - A band that I've known and enjoyed since my old roommate in
  Vancouver played them for me. The concert was in an old church and despite not
  knowing much of their catalogue, there wasn't a song I didn't enjoy.
* **Lizzard** - My friend Pip was adamant that I check out this band. I was
  floored by how good of a show they put on for what was probably a crowd of 50
  people.

## Music Discovery

Music discovery transformed a lot in 2024. The podcast that had been the source
of discovery for nearly a decade, [All Songs Considered][allsongs], changed
direction with the [retirement of Bob Boilen][bobdeparture]. Therefore I don't
have much of a journal on how or where I learnt about some bands.

[allsongs]: https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510019/all-songs-considered
[bobdeparture]: https://pitchfork.com/news/bob-boilen-all-songs-considered-and-tiny-desk-founder-leaving-npr-after-35-years/

The being said, some of the concerts I went to were for bands I discovered
through the podcast, so the spirit still lives on:

* **Yard Act** [source][yardact-source]
* **Marika Hackman** [source][marika-source]
* **Lankum** [source][lankum-source]
* **Moon Hooch** [source][moonhooch-source]

[marika-source]: https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2019/05/28/727227766/new-mix-rhye-quinn-christopherson-t-th-another-sky-ari-roar-more
[lankum-source]: https://www.npr.org/2019/10/21/771982922/lankum-and-the-strange-new-sounds-of-ireland
[moonhooch-source]: https://www.npr.org/2020/02/24/808918118/new-mix-jay-som-moon-hooch-ada-lea-more

Looking at the list of concerts, I think I owe a thank you to my old Vancouver
roommate, Doug Mason (aka The Newf). He introduced me to the following bands:

* **Calexico**
* **The Lemon Twigs** (an email from 2017)
* **Air**
* **The Nits**
* **Floating Points** (an email from 2018)

Over the last few years, a new form of music discovery has entered my life. It's
called **Music Church** and how it works warrants its own post. There are so
many bands that I'm into now as a result of this.

Concerts I attended by bands I discovered via **Music Church**:

* **Altin Gün**
* **Sleep Token**
* **Baroness**

## Summary

Live music is still awesome as is the album listening experience. I'm also
growing an appreciation for my organic music discovery channels. Algorithmic
music discovery has never appealed to me. It turns out just a handful of humans
can enrich your music journey beyond your music consumption capacity.
