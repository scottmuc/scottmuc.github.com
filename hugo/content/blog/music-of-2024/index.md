Last year's post was fun to write and I like the journalling component of this exercise. 2024 was an exceptional year
for great concerts. 27 of them to be precise!

## Music Discovery

Music discovery transformed a lot in 2024. The podcast that has been the source of discovery for nearly a decade, All
Songs Considered, changed direction with the retirement of Bob Boilen. Therefore I don't have much of a journal on how
or where I learnt about some bands.

Some of the concerts I went to were for bands I discovered through All Songs Considered.

* Marika Hackman
* Lankum
* Moon Hooch
* Floating Points

Over the last few years, a new form of music discovery has entered my life. It's called **Music Church** and how it
works warrants its own post. There are so many bands that I'm into now as a result of this.

Concerts I attended by bands I discovered via **Music Church**:

* Sleep Token
* Baroness

## Summary

Live music is still awesome as is the album listening experience.

*This post took 3 pomodoros (about the length of the playlist)*
