## Reflections on [2018](/my-resolutions-for-2018/)

This will be easy because I didn’t set any goals last year! It felt great to take a break from goal setting
because 2018 was a big year of transition. I [moved yet again][moving-again] and I started a new role at work.
I then found that it didn’t fit me and I finally had some self awareness to reach out for help and was able
to switch roles again to something that suits me at this moment in time.

Here are some things I discovered about myself in 2018:

* Working from home for the first time and I absolutely love it! I don't believe I'll ever go back to
  having a regular commute again.
* My travel hunger has been satiated. I will be minimizing my travel until my appetite grows for it again.
* Berlin is truly where I want to settle down in the long term. So much so that I’ve bought a home
  here and I've just finished moving in!
* I love writing, but sometimes my output doesn't reach the public domain. I've written more in 2018
  than probably any other year.

## Goals for 2019:

As always there are so many things I would like to do. I had a dozen blog post drafts that I ended up purging. I need to work
on my physical health too. Those who know me know that I have some very specific financial goals. To keep things
simple, I'm going to stick with one goal and approach it more like a project. For 2019, I would like to end the
year with a published [Let's Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Play) that has at least 50 views of the final
video in the series. This ought to be a good test on whether or not game recordings is something worth pursuing.

## Summary

I've sneakily already started on my goal with a completed series of Civilization VI! So far it's only been shared
with a private group of friends.

By-the-way, journaling ([goal from 2016](/my-resolutions-for-2016/)) has been the one habit that I’ve cultivated
and has lasted several years! Here are the numbers:
