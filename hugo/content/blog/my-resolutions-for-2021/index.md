## Reflections on 2020 and Earlier

I can't recall exactly why I didn't bother write a goal post (pun?) last year, but let's ignore that for now. I'm back
in action! Let's start with some reflections:

* Berlin has now been my home for 3 years. This is the longest I've lived somewhere outside of my home city since
  [Calgary][calgary-move] (over 11 years ago)! I'm loving my home and my life here so I don't see myself moving again
  anytime soon. Here's a view of my happy place in my flat (Meine Wohnung).

* I managed to do start some initiatives related to my [2019 goal][2019-goals] around game streaming!. My videos have
  been vieed 377 times and watched for 71hrs. The [Soul Level 1 Dark Souls play through][soul-level1] is by far my favourite. It's
  really a shame I lost episode 1 on Twitch. I learned that doing these streams and videos does take a lot of time and
  energy and doing it while working full time is not feasible for me (I did these videos during a couple months break
  from work).

* Journal entries: 27 - I found myself writing in my journal a lot less in 2020. This is not something I want to abandon
  this year. Reading my previous entries has been valuable to me. That being said, I've probably written more words in
  2020 than previous years, they just aren't publically accessible. My internal work journal probably has more than 27
  entries.

## Goals for 2021:

* **Permanent Residence** - Given how much I gush about living here, you would think I'm a permanent resident? Nope, my
  residency here depends on my work permit. I want to break this coupling.
* **Winding Down Work** - I'm reaching a point where I would prefer to have more time in my life than money. Success
  will be reducing my hours somehow (most preferrably working 4 days a week). This is primarily for obligitaory employed
  work. I know I'll never stop working :-)
* **Cycling Initiative** - I bought a bike this year, and given that all things are pointing to me sticking around
  Berlin, I'm not as concerned about have to either sell it or transport it. I've been dealing with all sorts of
  different pains in my legs/knees/back ever since I injured myself training for a half marathon in 2015. Riding a bike
  has been the best activity for me. Even walking long distances hasn't been good. I want to incorporate bicycling with
  how I travel and experience Germany. I have a MASSIVE goal around biking to Luxembourg for a wedding.

* **Launch Personal Finance Site** - The first two goals wouldn't have seemed feasible to me but the way I've been
  managing my money has opened them up to me. At the moment there's a skeleton of a website for a project that I've
  called [Good Enough Money][gem].

## Summary

I'm looking forward to shaking things up a bit. My appetite for risk and adventure is back. Funny how in my last update
I mention my travel hunger is satiated. That's certainly turning around now.
