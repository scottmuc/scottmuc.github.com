## Reflections on [2017](/my-resolutions-for-2017/)

* **Perform 1 pull up** - This didn't go so well. I'm now the heaviest that I've ever been (95kg). My psoriasis (scalp) has become really annoying and gets worse when I exercise. So 2017 wasn't a good year for my health. It's very clear that I don't handle disruption of my routine very well. Below is a graph of my workouts:

Only 1 or 2 of those gaps was related to illness; most of them were due to travel (work and play). The last few months was me being preoccupied with my move to Berlin (yet another excuse).

* **journaling** - I also took a look at if I adhered to my [2016](/my-resolutions-for-2016/) goal to maintain a journal. The following graph shows that I started the year off strong and then it faded away for a bit.

I've been looking back in my journal periodically now and finding it a great source of insight into what my previous self was thinking. I'm happy I've started picking it up last month.

## Goal for 2018:

Inspired by [Cate Huston](https://medium.com/@catehstn/the-2018liberation-list-4e229bdbb919), I'm going to liberate myself from making a goal for this year. I've just moved back to Berlin and will spend this year settling in and exploring.

This doesn't mean I'm not going to doing anything about my personal health, I just am not deciding what it is at this current moment.

## Summary

2018 is going to be a year of settling down and some reflection. I'm happy to have found a home where I'm excited by the prospect of being there for many years. I'm just going to let that feeling spawn iniatives as the year goes on.
