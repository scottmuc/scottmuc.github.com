		Why a links post about Git? There are plenty of resources, right? Exactly! There&rsquo;s almost too many resources around Git and you can reach a profiency in Git with just a few.
For fun, check out the results of this search for git books vs svn books. Hopefully this post will help you to never need to go through that list.
Some Opinions It&rsquo;s funny to me that git is a tool one can become skilled at.

		Background The Day the Universe Changed is a documentary (9.1 on imdb) from 1985 that covers the effects of science and technology on western society. I was introduced to the show in grade 8 social studies and I clearly didn&rsquo;t appreciate the message of the documentary when I was 13-14 years old.
Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not viewable online. However, this first 10 minutes of the first episode should be enough to get your gears turning.

		Reflections on 2018 This will be easy because I didn’t set any goals last year! It felt great to take a break from goal setting because 2018 was a big year of transition. I moved yet again and I started a new role at work. I then found that it didn’t fit me and I finally had some self awareness to reach out for help and was able to switch roles again to something that suits me at this moment in time.

		Reflections on 2017  Perform 1 pull up - This didn&rsquo;t go so well. I&rsquo;m now the heaviest that I&rsquo;ve ever been (95kg). My psoriasis (scalp) has become really annoying and gets worse when I exercise. So 2017 wasn&rsquo;t a good year for my health. It&rsquo;s very clear that I don&rsquo;t handle disruption of my routine very well. Below is a graph of my workouts:  {% img center /images/blog/workouts-2017.png 1024 %}

Remember that post about moving to Dublin from almost a couple years ago? Consider this a tiny git revert --no-commit of that, modify it slightly to keep my location as Berlin but Pivotal as my employer.
A Pivotal Moment (that has lasted 2 years) The whole process started with a strong desire to move back to Berlin (I&rsquo;ll go into why later). I was willing to look for a different job but I really really didn&rsquo;t want to.

	<div>
		This is embarassing to admit but I have to re-learn Transport Layer Security (TLS) on a continuous basis. This post is my cheatsheet to remembering all the itty bitty details, which I&rsquo;ll forgot shortly after I do whatever TLS related task I have on my plate.
What&rsquo;s TLS you ask? Take 9 minutes to listen to this fantastic episode on Public key cryptography which will prime (hah!) you up for the rest of the post.

Disclaimer - I was not paid or propositioned to write this post and/or link to the Mitchell &amp; Son web store. I just enjoyed their course a lot. At the end of the course I was given a 10€ discount on any Green/Yellow spot whiskies. I would also recommend the Celtic Whiskey Shop too.
Over the last month I had the wonderful opportunity of learning all about Irish whiskey.

		2016 was the first time I accomplished my goal!
Reflections on 2016  Write in a Journal - This one I am marking as a success. Here are the (manually) calculated stats:  Jan 9 Feb 3 Mar 12 Apr 9 May 15 Jun 9 Jul 13 Aug 14 Sep 12 Oct 14 Nov 9 Dec 12 I wrote 143 journal entries over the course of 2016. After counting them all up there are far fewer than I thought, but the frequency is actually more consistent than I thought.

		A few years ago I left ThoughtWorks and was considering leaving IT altogether.
{% blockquote Me http://scottmuc.com/leaving-a-dream-job-and-going-on-an-adventure/ Leaving a Dream Job and Going on an Adventure %} Though I’m listing things related to ThoughtWorks, a lot of my weariness is more from IT in general. It could be an age thing, but I’ve been around long enough to see a lot of terrible things going on in this industry. No one seems to care about security, and the innovation that is making billions in the stock market are consumer products that mean almost nothing to me.
