      <title>Music of 2023</title>

      <description>Music has been a big part of my life since at least 1990. It was a great bonding moment with my oldest brother as we both got into They Might Be Giants - Flood at the same time (and independently). He got me into going to concerts, and indie music.&#xA;My joy and participation in music has been a constant and I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed sharing my experiences and discoveries. This is my attempt at turning what is usually an e-mail to a few friends into a blog post.</description>

      <description>Over a year ago I posted a life update, and now it’s time for another! In Nov 2021 I hinted about a new job I was starting. So let&amp;rsquo;s go back a year and see how that developed.&#xA;2022 Entering ClimatePartner The cliffhanger that I ended the last post with was getting a job with ClimatePartner as a team lead. A team lead in this context was a mix of tech leadership and people management.</description>

      <description>It’s been a while since I’ve done a general life update. I’m no longer active on social media and have left a lot of people out of what’s going on in my life. One effect of my lack of posting was that my immediate family didn’t know much about my day-to-day life. Social media used to be good for this type of communication until it became more of an opinion soap-box.</description>

      <description>Reflections on 2020 and Earlier I can&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly why I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother write a goal post (pun?) last year, but let&amp;rsquo;s ignore that for now. I&amp;rsquo;m back in action! Let&amp;rsquo;s start with some reflections:&#xA;Berlin has now been my home for 3 years. This is the longest I&amp;rsquo;ve lived somewhere outside of my home city since Calgary (over 11 years ago)! I&amp;rsquo;m loving my home and my life here so I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself moving again anytime soon.</description>

      <description>Why a links post about Git? There are plenty of resources, right? Exactly! There&amp;rsquo;s almost too many resources around Git and you can reach a profiency in Git with just a few.&#xA;For fun, check out the results of this search for git books vs svn books. Hopefully this post will help you to never need to go through that list.&#xA;Some Opinions It&amp;rsquo;s funny to me that git is a tool one can become skilled at.</description>

      <description>Background The Day the Universe Changed is a documentary (9.1 on imdb) from 1985 that covers the effects of science and technology on western society. I was introduced to the show in grade 8 social studies and I clearly didn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate the message of the documentary when I was 13-14 years old.&#xA;Unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s not viewable online. However, this first 10 minutes of the first episode should be enough to get your gears turning.</description>

      <description>Reflections on 2018 This will be easy because I didn’t set any goals last year! It felt great to take a break from goal setting because 2018 was a big year of transition. I moved yet again and I started a new role at work. I then found that it didn’t fit me and I finally had some self awareness to reach out for help and was able to switch roles again to something that suits me at this moment in time.</description>

      <description>Reflections on 2017 Perform 1 pull up - This didn&amp;rsquo;t go so well. I&amp;rsquo;m now the heaviest that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been (95kg). My psoriasis (scalp) has become really annoying and gets worse when I exercise. So 2017 wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good year for my health. It&amp;rsquo;s very clear that I don&amp;rsquo;t handle disruption of my routine very well. Below is a graph of my workouts: Only 1 or 2 of those gaps was related to illness; most of them were due to travel (work and play).</description>

      <description>Remember that post about moving to Dublin from almost a couple years ago? Consider this a tiny git revert --no-commit of that, modify it slightly to keep my location as Berlin but Pivotal as my employer.&#xA;A Pivotal Moment (that has lasted 2 years) The whole process started with a strong desire to move back to Berlin (I&amp;rsquo;ll go into why later). I was willing to look for a different job but I really really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to.</description>

      <description>This is embarassing to admit but I have to re-learn Transport Layer Security (TLS) on a continuous basis. This post is my cheatsheet to remembering all the itty bitty details, which I&amp;rsquo;ll forgot shortly after I do whatever TLS related task I have on my plate.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s TLS you ask? Take 9 minutes to listen to this fantastic episode on Public key cryptography which will prime (hah!) you up for the rest of the post.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer - I was not paid or propositioned to write this post and/or link to the Mitchell &amp;amp; Son web store. I just enjoyed their course a lot. At the end of the course I was given a 10€ discount on any Green/Yellow spot whiskies. I would also recommend the Celtic Whiskey Shop too.&#xA;Over the last month I had the wonderful opportunity of learning all about Irish whiskey. It was held in the Mitchell and Son store in The CHQ Building (where I work) so how could I not participate?</description>

Here are the (manually) calculated stats: Jan 9 Feb 3 Mar 12 Apr 9 May 15 Jun 9 Jul 13 Aug 14 Sep 12 Oct 14 Nov 9 Dec 12 I wrote 143 journal entries over the course of 2016. After counting them all up there are far fewer than I thought, but the frequency is actually more consistent than I thought.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I left ThoughtWorks and was considering leaving IT altogether.&#xA;{% blockquote Me http://scottmuc.com/leaving-a-dream-job-and-going-on-an-adventure/ Leaving a Dream Job and Going on an Adventure %} Though I’m listing things related to ThoughtWorks, a lot of my weariness is more from IT in general. It could be an age thing, but I’ve been around long enough to see a lot of terrible things going on in this industry. No one seems to care about security, and the innovation that is making billions in the stock market are consumer products that mean almost nothing to me.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted a &amp;ldquo;life update&amp;rdquo;. The TL;DR is that I have joined Pivotal Cloud Foundry in January and will be moving to Dublin in June.&#xA;Reflections on Berlin and SoundCloud My guess is the most frequent question about this is: what happened? When I posted about my decision to move to Berlin and join SoundCloud it appeared that I had found something I really wanted to do.</description>

      <title>How to make Masala Chai</title>

      <description>This is the simplest masala chai recipe I know how to make. Compared to the street side chai you would get in India my recipe differs in the fact that mine is less sweet and has a strong black tea and masala flavour (especially the ginger). The wonderful thing about masala chai is that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to adjust to your own taste and it&amp;rsquo;s fun to experiment with.&#xA;So let&amp;rsquo;s get started!</description>

      <description>This has become a bit of a tradition for me so I can&amp;rsquo;t quite writing these now. This one will be a bit different than the previous ones though. Normally these posts are my technical resolutions. I&amp;rsquo;m not that ambitious anymore when it comes to technical learning so I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped that from the title. Even though I tend to despise meaningless dates, I look at resolutions as one large pomodoro. So the tradition lives on!</description>

      <description>September 20th - December 16th&#xA;Ugh, I left this post until way too late. Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;ll have to drop a lot of detail as 3 months is pretty hard to sum up in a single blog post. Hopefully I can do it justice as India is a place I&amp;rsquo;m very fond of. I feel bad for all the wonderful little experiences that happened and didn&amp;rsquo;t get written about. I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to visit India again and properly journal the whole experience.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been an off and on jogger for the last 2 years, but my goal is to be a jogger for the rest of my life. For some reason I&amp;rsquo;ve felt compelled to journal my reasons. If one person thinks to take up jogging, then that would be wonderful.&#xA;Inspiration The Oatmeal made a fantastic comic of his reasons for running and found that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of overlap. Of course I don&amp;rsquo;t run ultra marathons, nor have I been running for a decade, but I find this comic inspirational and I look at it every couple months.</description>

      <guid>https://scottmuc.com/hugo/blog/what-makes-something-a-devops-tool/</guid>
      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;devops&amp;rdquo; has only existed for 5 years and the trend is to label your tool as a devops tool in order for it to gain traction. When I look at the landscape of tools, most look like Ops tools, just relabeled.&#xA;The reason this has been on my mind is that myself and Subhas released a website called Devops Bookmarks to aggregate all the tools in the landscape. Using a Github Pull Request for contributions results in reviewing a lot of tools and after a short amount of time I found myself second-guessing the need for such a website.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t say exactly when the job search began. It began with the creation of a Note in Evernote (great tool for this type of task). It was much different than any other job search I&amp;rsquo;ve done, though I haven&amp;rsquo;t done many as I tend to stick to job for at least 4 years at a time. The key difference with this search was that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a hurry to find a job.</description>

An accompaniment to the course is the book, A Mind for Numbers by Barbara Oakley (the primary course instructor), which is a short read but very insightful and full of references.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite surprising that I haven&amp;rsquo;t really brought up the topic of podcasts on my blog considering that I&amp;rsquo;ve been consuming them for almost 10 years! My methods and taste have changed a lot over the years. I want a place to point people when asked about what podcasts I listen to, and with a little more context than just a pure list.&#xA;Software / Tools A podcast is such a simple concept (from the technical side) that it allows for a lot of tools and applications to be created around the idea.</description>

      <description>August 17th - August 29th&#xA;Ukraine The next leg of the journey was a long slog from Vienna to L’viv. I took a noon train to Budapest and had to pass some time there for a little while. From Budapest it was an overnight journey with many frequent stops in the middle of the night for immigration and customs. If you’ve ever played Papers, Please, it felt like that. Ukraine isn’t part of the Schengen agreement so you can’t just cross the border without a documents check.</description>

It turned out it fit perfectly! The last time I saw them was in London while they were doing their 2013 summer trip and I was on my Belgian Grand Prix vacation. My aunt and uncle are well versed in the world of business so we had many evenings discussing what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from the economics courses and floating ideas of what&amp;rsquo;s next for my life.</description>

      <description>In the Beginning In 2010 I was on a project that focused on build and release software for a bunch of .Net projects (and a few Java projects). Our &amp;ldquo;glue&amp;rdquo; was written in PowerShell because of the wonderful remoting capabilities and it&amp;rsquo;s integration with Windows automation. Our code was untested and our code base was growing over time because our tools proved to be useful and we were getting more and more feedback.</description>

      <description>July 22nd - July 29th&#xA;Prague Next portion of the trip is to Eastern Europe! I had a nice simple itinerary to Prague: Heidelberg -&amp;gt; Munich -&amp;gt; Prague. Unfortunately something was going on with the brakes on the train and I missed my train in Munich so it turned into: Heidelberg -&amp;gt; Munich -&amp;gt; Neurberg -&amp;gt; Cheb -&amp;gt; Prague. By now I&amp;rsquo;m a seasoned itinerary refactorer so this didn&amp;rsquo;t phase me.</description>

      <description>July 7th - July 21st&#xA;Reunions in Glasgow Since my train didn&amp;rsquo;t leave until after noon, I decided to go back to Bletchley Park and spend the morning there. It was so nice to just spend some idle time in the park and not hurry through the exhibits. Unrushed, I made my way to the train station for a direct train to Glasgow. Upon arrival at the station I was greeted by Derek and Rose who I know from back in the Calgary days.</description>

      <description>June 24th - July 7th&#xA;Shipment Delivered Upon arrival in Antwerp I saw my taxi from the deck. I had all my belongings ready and made my way down to the port. The ship crew was busy with the offloading of containers so I decided it probably wasn’t a good idea to disturb them to say farewell. It was a long drive to the immigration office, and there I found out that I needed a passenger manifest to get the stamp of approval.</description>

If you can believe it, the weather in Vancouver was 99% rain free!&#xA;Schools Out for Summer During my downtime I&amp;rsquo;ve enrolled in the Economics of Banking and Money on Coursera. I never thought I would find learning this stuff so much fun! To supplement the course material, I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to the following podcasts too:</description>

      <description>For some context, you may want to read my previous post about quitting my job.&#xA;I am homeless and unemployed in probably the most priveleged meaning of the terms. Both states of being are choices I&amp;rsquo;ve explicitly made. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve read, I&amp;rsquo;m not really on a sabbatical, but I&amp;rsquo;m on a Career Break, except the homeless aspect of it is not as conventional.&#xA;So here are the reflections:&#xA;Where Am I Sleeping Tonight On September 1st 2012 I gave up my awesome apartment in Calgary as I prepared for an assignment in India (without really knowing where I was going after that).</description>

      <description>On January 4th 2010 I joined ThoughtWorks and it has been an amazing journey. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen more systems, worked with more people, and seen more countries than the entire 30 years that preceded that date. I still can&amp;rsquo;t believe how lucky I&amp;rsquo;ve been to have such a wonderful opportunity. That&amp;rsquo;s why it took me a long time to decide to leave it, and go on a bit of an adventure.</description>

My motivations are changing a bit and growing strong technically isn&amp;rsquo;t one of my top priorities nowadays.&#xA;Reflections on 2013 Last year was very interesting for me. It&amp;rsquo;s the first time I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a home. I&amp;rsquo;ve split my time between India, United States, and South Africa, (ok, I was in Toronto for a few weeks too). During that time I&amp;rsquo;ve reflected a lot (probably too much).</description>

Usually when they are pertinent to a problem they are having, or to supplement a conversation I&amp;rsquo;ve had with them. My usual process to reproduce these links ends up being a search in: Twitter, Pocket, History, and my Bookmarks.&#xA;Also, when I share my links I tend to write a few sentences about them.</description>

One of them had to re-map copy and paste because they messed that up, but they felt awesome when they figured out a clever work around.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there at some point. It&amp;rsquo;s something that you grow out of over time. At least I hope so.</description>

      <description>Developers like to talk about being in a state of flow. This is when time just seems to fly by and you&amp;rsquo;re writing more code in a few hours than you do in several days when you&amp;rsquo;re not &amp;ldquo;flowing&amp;rdquo;. While I think flowing can be postive, it often can do more harm than good if going on for too long.&#xA;In the past I would complain that the environment around me kept me from the flow.</description>

      <description>After a whirlwind of activity on the Pester codebase I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the latest release of Pester. Versions 1.2 and 2 are identical feature wise except for one subtle difference that I&amp;rsquo;ll get into soon.&#xA;New Expectation and Matcher Syntax In prior versions of Pester, we have the dot notation expectation and matcher syntax&#xA;$some_string.should.be(&amp;#34;some value&amp;#34;) This required some clever and downright nasty hacks to the PowerShell runtime. This created a few issues for some users and I wanted to get that fixed.</description>

This year&amp;rsquo;s conference was no exception and here is a summary of what I experienced:&#xA;Day 1 The Audubon Society for Partial Failures The first presentation was done by Cliff Moon. He argues that there are many common patterns in the IT space and it would be valuable to have a repository of knowledge that we can visit to read about the types of errors that can happen.</description>

      <description>On a previous project, I witnessed a few interesting build breakages that we caught in CI that could have easily gotten passed our automated quality gates. These issues would have hurt us in downstream environments.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s commonly referenced in the Continuous Delivery book that development environments should be as close to production like as possible. This might not be 100% possible but you can come close. What can come that close is your system integration test environment.</description>

Here are a few things that I noticed:&#xA;Culture The attitude and culture around the people there was incredible. Everyone was focused on the needs of the business that they worked for. Sometimes it meant making developers more productive by being to provide consistent environments or by lessening the pain operations have to go through in order to release software created by development teams.</description>

      <description>The one thing that has always annoyed me with installing ruby on Windows is that at some point in time I always need to setup the DevKit because I want to install gems that require native extensions. Also, I want the ability to switch between different versions of ruby.&#xA;Introducing Yari yari is a tool (implemented in Powershell) I&amp;rsquo;ve made to simplify both of these operations. Right now it&amp;rsquo;s hard coded to only install the 2 ruby versions I care about right now.</description>

      <description>As a publisher for a few Powershell modules I&amp;rsquo;m getting frustrated by the lack of standarization in the community on how to support versioning, deployment and conventions within Powershell module distribution. All I can find is rather adhoc mechanisms of sharing poorly written code with the &amp;ldquo;use at your own risk&amp;rdquo; kinds of disclaimers.&#xA;I keep on looking at the ruby community with their amazing tools like rvm, ruby gems, and bundler to make ruby scripting highly testable and repeatable.</description>

For a while I thought Nuget was the way but it&amp;rsquo;s tight coupling to Visual Studio made it feel like it wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite the right fit for PowerShell.&#xA;Mike Chaliy has made probably what could be called the simplest thing that could possibly work, and it works well! It&amp;rsquo;s called PsGet (not to be confused with another project called PsGet).</description>

      <description>Hi there and welcome to my demo of Pester, a BDD style testing framework for Powershell. The creation of Pester came out of the desire to test some build/deployment infrastructure we were creating for a project. We wrote nearly all the code without tests and it came to bite us in the end. I wanted to find a way ensure these problems didn&amp;rsquo;t happen again as well as provide some code coverage to give new entrants to the codebase some confidence that they won&amp;rsquo;t break everything.</description>

      <description>Think about how you get good at anything. What do you remember spending most of your time on? Most likely you spent the majority of your time messing things up and getting it wrong. Why are kids so quick at picking up new skills, especially dangerous ones? It&amp;rsquo;s because kids are fearless experimenters. I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning how to skate and ski and my ability to learn is hindered by my concern of hurting myself; potentially preventing me from working and earning a living.</description>

      <description>Looking back at 2010 I can&amp;rsquo;t say I did a good job of following through with my resolutions, but I believe I have a valid excuse! For the last 12 months I&amp;rsquo;ve been working more as a build/release specialist than a software developer. Anyways, here&amp;rsquo;s a rundown of what I didn&amp;rsquo;t accomplish last year:&#xA;Test Driven Design - I barely coded at all so that was a total flop. I also believe that this is something that&amp;rsquo;s hard to do on your own.</description>

      <description>As many of you know, I have left CBC Radio 3 and got a position as a Software Consultant with Thoughtworks Calgary. Considering that I have lived my entire life in the lower mainland of BC this is a big change. Not only am I leaving behind many friends and family, a beautiful city, and a great job, I&amp;rsquo;m also leaving behind my golf membership gasp. At least with the Internet, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to remain in touch and this blog is one of the many ways I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping in touch.</description>

      <description>In a recent splurge I purchased 4 books from Manning Press with one of them being The Art of Unit Testing by Roy Osherove.&#xA;I would categorize myself as relatively new to unit testing. My first hands on testing was when I took the Nothing but .Net bootcamp with JP Boodhoo but he emphasized BDD style tests. I saw the benefit of BDD but didn&amp;rsquo;t feel I had the know how to implement them properly.</description>

      <description>Lines of code has always been a poor guide in measuring developer productivity. I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading Scott Rosenberg&amp;rsquo;s Dreaming In Code and came across and interesting quote.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Atkinson [ed: Bill] had just completed rewriting a portion of the Quickdraw code, making it more efficient and faster. The new version was 2000 lines of code shorter than the old one. What to report? He wrote the number -2000&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Rosenberg&#xA;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but smile when I read that.</description>

      <description>Ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve begun using NHibernate the number one thing that&amp;rsquo;s caused me a lot of headaches is learning how to properly map my domain objects. Even the most basic mappings I wrote had bugs simple because I overlooked trivial items. This made me realize that I could save a lot of time and hassle if I unit tested by data access layer.&#xA;Ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve begun using NHibernate the number one thing that&amp;rsquo;s caused me a lot of headaches is learning how to properly map my domain objects.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get comfortable with NHibernate but I&amp;rsquo;ve been cowboy coding it without any testing framework to let me know if my mappings are really doing what I think they are doing. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get tired of manually interacting with my applications to see if things work so I&amp;rsquo;ve begun the course of starting database integration testing. For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s all about testing my mapping files.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never made any New Years resolutions before. This year I&amp;rsquo;m going to break that trend simply to create a checklist of tasks to keep me on track. I easily get distracted, but having to check things off a list is a sure way for me to stay focused.&#xA;Not wanting to over do it, I made goals that are easily attainable. Hopefully upon completion I&amp;rsquo;ll get more ambitious the next time around.</description>

After some internal reflection I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with my top 5 things I strongly feel that I won&amp;rsquo;t compromise on in the web development process.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m creating an automated build process and one of the items in the build is to build an external resource which is a java script library. The javascript is contained in multiple files and I want to concatenate them into one script. I found a very useful tool called JS Builder which has a command line executable which I can use to automate the construction of this javascript file.&#xA;Setup was very simple.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into the book Getting Things Done lately and can identify with many of the ideas it discusses. The one idea I really like is the consolidation of Inboxes.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m of the camp that likes to have a pristine desktop. I personally think the desktop should never be seen, and if it is then you&amp;rsquo;re not managing your windows properly. When things go on my desktop I naturally try to clean them up.</description>

      <description>After attending Nothing But .Net Bootcamp I noticed none of the classes that were written in the course had a Manager suffix. I&amp;rsquo;ve sort had a eureka moment and have a good idea on why this is.&#xA;JP heavily emphasized the Single Responsibility Principle throughout the course. If a class is only has a single responsibility it will be pretty difficult to attach a Manager suffix to the class name.</description>

      <description>After a big of pleading I got the privilege of being able to attend Jean-Paul Boodhoo&amp;rsquo;s Nothing But Dot Net Bootcamp!&#xA;JP is quite well known in the .Net circuit for his passion for development and his pragmatic approach to software design. Typical posts about his course underline that you&amp;rsquo;ll be giving up your home life for a week. Since I&amp;rsquo;m a bachelor, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal for me, but I did feel a bit bad for the guys that had wives and kids at home.</description>

      <description>Matt Hamilton wrote an excellent blog post about something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a long time. As a developer you want to keep improving, but the more you know the more choices that appear.&#xA;When first coding projects that require database access you get used to learning the SqlCommand class and have nested using statements to retrieve your readers. Next thing you learn is strong typed DataSets and then you move on to ORMs and code generators.</description>

      <description>For the last 7 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been running a FreeBSD server at home for all my file serving needs. It&amp;rsquo;s always been solid and never caused problems. It was the gateway into Unix knowledge for me and I loved the whole experience. A fellow 8-ball competitor revealed that he&amp;rsquo;s a sales agent for Microsoft and kindly gave me an OEM copy of Windows Home Server (WHS)! I reluctantly decided to retire the ol BSD box and try out WHS.</description>
