      <description>For the last 7 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been running a FreeBSD server at home for all my file serving needs. It&amp;rsquo;s always been solid and never caused problems. It was the gateway into Unix knowledge for me and I loved the whole experience.

      <description>{% img right /images/blog/aboutme.jpg 400 %} Hello Internet and welcome to my tiny slice of Internet real-estate. My name is Scott and I grew up in Vancouver, Canada, but now my current location updates quite frequently. Just assume that I&amp;rsquo;m somewhere on planet Earth.
This website is a hodge podge of things that have inspired me enough to write about them. It&amp;rsquo;s gone from being quick technical to now a tiny platform for me to write about life experiences and the like.</description>
