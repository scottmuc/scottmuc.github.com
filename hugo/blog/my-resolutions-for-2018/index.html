<ul>
<li><strong>Perform 1 pull up</strong> - This didn&rsquo;t go so well. I&rsquo;m now the heaviest that I&rsquo;ve ever been (95kg). My psoriasis (scalp) has become really annoying and gets worse when I exercise. So 2017 wasn&rsquo;t a good year for my health. It&rsquo;s very clear that I don&rsquo;t handle disruption of my routine very well. Below is a graph of my workouts:</li>
</ul>

<p>Only 1 or 2 of those gaps was related to illness; most of them were due to travel (work and play). The last few months was me being preoccupied with my move to Berlin (yet another excuse).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>journaling</strong> - I also took a look at if I adhered to my <a href="/my-resolutions-for-2016/">2016</a> goal to maintain a journal. The following graph shows that I started the year off strong and then it faded away for a bit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking back in my journal periodically now and finding it a great source of insight into what my previous self was thinking. I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;ve started picking it up last month.</p>
<h2 id="goal-for-2018">Goal for 2018:</h2>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@catehstn/the-2018liberation-list-4e229bdbb919">Cate Huston</a>, I&rsquo;m going to liberate myself from making a goal for this year. I&rsquo;ve just moved back to Berlin and will spend this year settling in and exploring.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not going to doing anything about my personal health, I just am not deciding what it is at this current moment.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>2018 is going to be a year of settling down and some reflection. I&rsquo;m happy to have found a home where I&rsquo;m excited by the prospect of being there for many years. I&rsquo;m just going to let that feeling spawn iniatives as the year goes on.</p>
