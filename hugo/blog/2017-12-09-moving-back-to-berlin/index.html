			<h1>Moving Back to Berlin</h1>

<p>Remember that <a href="/joining-pivotal-cloud-foundry-and-moving-to-dublin/">post about moving to Dublin</a> from almost a couple years ago? Consider this a tiny <code>git revert --no-commit</code> of that, modify it slightly to keep my location as Berlin but Pivotal as my employer.</p>
<h2 id="a-pivotal-moment-that-has-lasted-2-years">A Pivotal Moment (that has lasted 2 years)</h2>
<p>The whole process started with a strong desire to move back to Berlin (I&rsquo;ll go into why later). I was willing to look for a different job but I really really didn&rsquo;t want to. Pivotal has been fantastic and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it there. Since I joined I&rsquo;ve worked on 3 different teams over 2 years:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager">Ops Manager</a></strong> - A web platform for managing all the products offered on the <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Network</a> (think of this as an AppStore for Ops Manager)</li>
<li><strong>Release Engineering</strong> - A team responsible for packaging all the components of <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/">Cloud Foundry</a> in a <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime">package</a> that can install in <strong>Ops Manager</strong>. Now they support even more products and the automation to sustain it all is really impressive!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-rabbitmq">RabbitMQ for PCF</a></strong> - This is where I spent the bulk of my time (18 months). For part of the time I played software developer and for the majority of the time I played product manager. Both roles had a myriad of activities that cover the many facets of software delivery so I enjoyed this time very much.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all of these projects I got to work with great people who challenged me and allowed me to challenge them as well. The products themselves are also quite interesting and are gaining a lot of traction in the market. Cloud Foundry is something I would have enjoyed using if my primary activity was writing application code.</p>
<p>So, when I mentioned my desire to move to my manager, <a href="https://twitter.com/jamiemonserrate">Jamie Monseratte</a>,  he responded with support and positivity. I was able to explore the different things I could do in Berlin and eventually landed on a role called <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/pivotalsoftware/jobs/877047#.WiwIP7Q-fdQ">Platform Reliability Engineer</a> (we&rsquo;re hiring). It feels like it&rsquo;ll be a fun mix of enablement, hands on operations, and customer engagement. I&rsquo;ve learned that I love running software more than the building software so this appears to be a great fit for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a few days in the office and met everyone at the Christmas party (photo to be added soon). I already feel welcome!</p>
<h2 id="dublin">Dublin</h2>
<p>{% img center /images/blog/dublin-spree.jpg 1024 %}</p>
<p>Living in Dublin was a great experience. I&rsquo;ve learned all about <a href="/irish-whiskey-appreciation/">irish whiskey</a> which is now my favourite spirit. I&rsquo;ve made some friends and have visited more pubs than I can possible count. I&rsquo;m going to miss all the concert venues which became my home away from home.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-deal-with-berlin">What&rsquo;s The Deal With Berlin?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to explain why exactly I wanted to be back in Berlin. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever moved back to a city. The best way I can describe how I felt is that Berlin has the most gravity. Every location has a bit of gravity: Vancouver, San Francisco, Bangalore; But Berlin had sufficient gravity to pull me out of Dublin. You know a place is right when people describe the things they dislike about a city and you find those are the reasons why you like it.</p>
<p>In my head this is the last move I&rsquo;m going to be doing voluntarily. I wish to settle down in Berlin and make it the first place I&rsquo;ve lived in for longer than 2 years since I lived in Vancouver (which implies I haven&rsquo;t lived in the same city for longer than 18 months in the last 8 years).</p>
<p>In my first week in Berlin I&rsquo;ve found my new home. It&rsquo;s an interesting flat in Wilmersdorf. It&rsquo;s large, has lots of character, and is well connected to all of Berlin. I look forward to having you over :-)</p>
