			<h1>Valuable Links - TLS</h1>
			<div>
				<p>This is embarassing to admit but I have to re-learn Transport Layer Security (TLS) on a continuous basis. This post
is my cheatsheet to remembering all the itty bitty details, which I&rsquo;ll forgot shortly after I do whatever TLS related
task I have on my plate.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s TLS you ask? Take 9 minutes to listen to this fantastic episode on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04vqrwy">Public key cryptography</a>
which will prime (hah!) you up for the rest of the post.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-ssl-and-tls">What&rsquo;s The Difference Between SSL And TLS?</h2>
<p>The fact that I still think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL</a> over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> is likely a result of my first exposure to dealing with
these sorts of things was in a multi-tenant Windows web hosting environment. I seriously can&rsquo;t believe I was able to do
the things I did back then without having one iota of understanding what was going on.</p>
<p>I only learned that the difference between <em>SSL</em> and <em>TLS</em> is so simple just a couple years ago. It boils down to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you expecting a secure connection because the port you&rsquo;re connecting to is by definition intended to be a secure
port? Then we&rsquo;re talking about <strong>SSL</strong>.</li>
<li>Do you start connecting and switch to a secure mode based on the feedback coming back over the &ldquo;wire&rdquo;? Then we&rsquo;re
talking about <strong>TLS</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yup, it&rsquo;s as simple as that. Big thanks to the <a href="https://luxsci.com/blog/ssl-versus-tls-whats-the-difference.html">SSL vs TLS - What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a> post for helping
me finally understand this!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-certificates">What Are Certificates?</h2>
<p>When it comes to certifcates, I&rsquo;ve yet to find a resource that does a good high level explanation. For the time being
I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://blog.talpor.com/2015/07/ssltls-certificates-beginners-tutorial/">SSL/TLS Certificates Beginners&rsquo; Tutorial</a> the best resource because it does explain the <code>openssl</code>
command in a bit of detail and links to even more resources. Having a basic grasp of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Certificate Authorities</a>,
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_trust">chain of trust</a> (not a 90&rsquo;s Christian metal band) is another piece
of the puzzle to understand well because it&rsquo;s where things can often go wrong and result in cryptic errors
(like the browser warnings that we all ignore).</p>
<p>My simplified understanding is that a certificate certifies hat the one (machine) with the certificate is the entity
that the certificate says it&rsquo;s certifying. I believe this is true for server and client certificates, but I am not 100% sure.</p>
<h2 id="what-goes-on-when-you-use-https">What Goes On When You Use HTTPS?</h2>
<p>Nearly everytime I need to setup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> I find that I need to reread the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">First Few Milliseconds of an HTTPS Connection</a> article. It&rsquo;s a long read but if you spend a day following
the links and focusing on understanding that article, you&rsquo;ll tackle any <em>HTTPS</em> related task with ease. You&rsquo;ll just
forget it all after a few days.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.robinhowlett.com/blog/2016/01/05/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-ssl-but-were-afraid-to-ask/">Everything You Ever Wanted to Know SSL&hellip;</a> is another great post that dives deep into the low level of
what happens in creating a secure connection.</p>
<h2 id="hostname-verification">Hostname Verification</h2>
<p><a href="%22https://twitter.com/will_sargent%22">Will Sargent</a> wrote an excellent series on <a href="https://tersesystems.com/blog/2014/03/31/testing-hostname-verification/">Testing Hostname Verification</a>
which goes into the guts of many of the parts discussed in this post.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-things-go-wrong">How Do Things Go Wrong?</h2>
<p>The following video by <a href="https://moxie.org/">Moxie Marlinspike</a> is told at a nice slow pace on how certificates can break down.
It&rsquo;s a good reminder to be humble when dealing with these complex security tools. I tend to rewatch this video after
reading the above articles. If I can follow the video, then I&rsquo;ve chunked enough knowledge to move on.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Hope these help. It&rsquo;s inspired by all the other folks that also couldn&rsquo;t tell me the difference between SSL and TLS.
It&rsquo;s easy to feel ashamed about not knowing these technologies, security is a very hard domain. I&rsquo;ve kept my
explanations to a minimum because I don&rsquo;t feel confident I can provide correct information, nor am I able to explain it
simply. When in doubt, I&rsquo;ll look to the resources here. Hopefully this will give you a good starting ground if you&rsquo;ve
been asked to do anything related to <strong>SSL/TLS</strong> and <strong>certificates</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> I was contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/BlastYourBlog">Matt Banner</a> who asked me to update this article with some content from his
website. I took a look at it and it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.onblastblog.com/http-to-https/">really good guide</a> for updating from <code>http</code> to <code>https</code> (pop quiz, is
this SSL or TLS?) plus it has a really good infographic.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong> Found a couple more excellent resources on the subject. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzz3bcnWf7M">A Tour of TLS</a> is probably the clearest
video I&rsquo;ve watched on the subject. It clarified some of the more obscure pieces of the protocol like OCSP and Stapling
in such a way that I finally got it! <a href="https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki.html">Everything PKI</a> brings pretty much of what&rsquo;s in the Tour of
TLS video in the frame of a system operator (e.g.: through <code>openssl</code> commands).</p>
