			<h1>Book Review - Learning Continuous Integration with TeamCity by Manoj Mahalingam</h1>
			<div>
				<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - I personally know Manoj and have worked with him in the past. I was asked to review his book,
<a href="http://goo.gl/5wUy3v">Learning Continuous Integration with TeamCity</a>, by <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a>.</p>
<p>As someone who had spent many years consulting around the benefits of CI and implementing build and release strategies,
I was interested in how the minutiae would be brought up in a book.</p>
<p>The book begins by going through the creation and configuration of a similar build process for 3 specific tech stacks:
Java, .Net, and Ruby. At first it feels rather repetitive but the repetition actually helps reinforce the importance of
consistency. With all tech stacks, the procedure is pretty much the same: <code>Checkout, Build, Test, Package, Deploy, Run UI Tests</code>. This pattern really stands out after going through chapters 4, 5 and 6 and builds up a foundation for the
reader so that the rest of the material makes sense.</p>
<p>After setting the stage with these build configurations, he then dives into content that&rsquo;s a bit more TeamCity
specific. This area was much more interesting to me as I&rsquo;m already experienced with build and release concepts, but it
was nice to see TeamCity specific features explained in a little bit more depth.</p>
<p>One piece that felt a little out of place was the topic on Continuous Delivery. It&rsquo;s really hard to introduce a concept
that has a massive book dedicated to the subject. Not sure if its inclusion will help out the beginner that this book
appears to be targeting.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed the most was raising operational concerns around running a CI server system. It was likely
deliberately left out, but I would have liked to see a mention of automated configuration management. There&rsquo;s something
incredibly powerful around automation around your automation.</p>
<p>It became clear to me that this book is meant for the absolute beginner. Manoj hints at better ways of implementing
his example configurations (eg: using wrapper scripts over the built in runners) but doesn&rsquo;t distract the reader
with these possibly subjective tangents. I would recommend this book if you&rsquo;ve never worked with any CI tool and like
to have a guidebook as you try and set it up yourself. Despite being over 250 pages, the book is packed with
screenshots so that it&rsquo;s absolutely clear and won&rsquo;t take too long to go through the whole book. If you&rsquo;re already
experienced with some tools the principles around CI and good build hygiene, this book is useful to skim to see what&rsquo;s
new with TeamCity and some context of the usage of TeamCity specific features.</p>
