<p>This will be easy because I didn’t set any goals last year! It felt great to take a break from goal setting
because 2018 was a big year of transition. I <a href="/moving-back-to-berlin/">moved yet again</a> and I started a new role at work.
I then found that it didn’t fit me and I finally had some self awareness to reach out for help and was able
to switch roles again to something that suits me at this moment in time.</p>
<p>Here are some things I discovered about myself in 2018:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working from home for the first time and I absolutely love it! I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll ever go back to
having a regular commute again.</li>
<li>My travel hunger has been satiated. I will be minimizing my travel until my appetite grows for it again.</li>
<li>Berlin is truly where I want to settle down in the long term. So much so that I’ve bought a home
here and I&rsquo;ve just finished moving in!</li>
<li>I love writing, but sometimes my output doesn&rsquo;t reach the public domain. I&rsquo;ve written more in 2018
than probably any other year.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goals-for-2019">Goals for 2019:</h2>
<p>As always there are so many things I would like to do. I had a dozen blog post drafts that I ended up purging. I need to work
on my physical health too. Those who know me know that I have some very specific financial goals. To keep things
simple, I&rsquo;m going to stick with one goal and approach it more like a project. For 2019, I would like to end the
year with a published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Play">Let&rsquo;s Play</a> that has at least 50 views of the final
video in the series. This ought to be a good test on whether or not game recordings is something worth pursuing.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sneakily already started on my goal with a completed series of Civilization VI! So far it&rsquo;s only been shared
with a private group of friends.</p>
<p>By-the-way, journaling (<a href="/my-resolutions-for-2016/">goal from 2016</a>) has been the one habit that I’ve cultivated
and has lasted several years! Here are the numbers:</p>
