			<h1>Installing Windows Home Server On Old Hardware</h1>
			<time>27.04.2008 23:08</time>

				<p>For the last 7 years I&rsquo;ve been running a <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/" title="FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a> server at home for all my file serving needs. It&rsquo;s always been solid and never caused problems. It was the gateway into Unix knowledge for me and I loved the whole experience. A fellow 8-ball competitor revealed that he&rsquo;s a sales agent for Microsoft and kindly gave me an OEM copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Home_Server" title="Windows Home Server">Windows Home Server</a> (WHS)! I reluctantly decided to retire the ol BSD box and try out WHS.</p>
<p>The first thing I&rsquo;ll discuss is the hardware. The BSD fileserver did not have high hardware requirements so it never got upgraded often. Here&rsquo;s what I had to work with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tyan Trinity 400 Motherboard</li>
<li>Pentium III 866MHz</li>
<li>256MB Ram</li>
<li>3 Maxtor Hardrives (250GB, 80GB, 40GB)</li>
<li>Promise Ultra 66 Controller</li>
<li>Netgear NIC</li>
</ul>
<p>My first stumbling block was that I did not have a DVD drive. A few months ago I did a purge of almost all my computers (over a dozen) so my spare parts closet was a bit sparse. Fortunately my kind neighbor who lives about me loaned me her HP box and I was able to pull the DVD drive from that and use it.</p>
<p>With the box in DVD bootable condition I was able to get the installer going until I ran into my second bump. It complained that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface">ACPI</a> support was not found. Fortunately that was a simple BIOS setting. I did a lot of messing around with the BIOS a while back and was unsure what changes what could complicate matters so I reverted the BIOS back to its defaults and I got past that point without further issues.</p>
<p>The next block was the installer would not continue with less than 512MB of RAM. The Tyan motherboard only has 3 DIMM slots and I couldn&rsquo;t find any sticks larger than 128MB! Fortunately I remembered that my old dev server had 512MB in it so I was able to scoop a couple 256MB DIMMs from it.</p>
<p>A quick reboot later and I now discover that the installer does not have drivers for my Promise card. Instead of trying to find drivers I decided to ditch the card. Sure I&rsquo;ll only have ATA 33 hardrive speeds but who cares since my network will be more of a bottleneck anyways and I&rsquo;m the only user too. Hopefully this decision doesn&rsquo;t come and haunt me later.</p>

<p>Finally I am at a point where the installer gets going! Figuring that this was going to take a while I take a break and watch <a href="http://www.pgatour.com/golfers/024502/adam-scott/">Adam Scott</a> win the Byron Nelson Championship. Go Adam Scott!</p>
<p>A few hours later it&rsquo;s now booting into Windows Server 2003 and it&rsquo;s getting ready to install the Home Server component. For some reason the final portion of the install keeps on crashing without much of an error message. Not too sure what&rsquo;s going on I try to &lsquo;Windows Key&rsquo; my way back to the desktop to see what&rsquo;s going on. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t recall where I saw this, but I noticed a message displaying a &lsquo;getting updates&rsquo; kind of message. I got into the Device Manager as fast as I could and noticed the <em>Netgear NIC</em> is not being detected. I found my usual standby <em>3com 3c905b NIC</em> in the closet and that worked like a charm and the crashes stopped.</p>
<p>Everything then went smoothly! <em>39</em> Windows Updates had to be installed but that&rsquo;s to be expected. I have the box back on my rack and am currently copying over the gigs of content back to the server. All in all it wasn&rsquo;t a bad install experience but I got quite lucky with a lot of my troubleshooting. I&rsquo;m sure all of those problems would have been averted had I worked with modern hardware.</p>
<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s my tale of installing WHS on older hardware. I hope this encourages people to recycle their old computers for this task rather than throwing them away. I always love getting the most out of old computer hardware that people think is useless. Heck, to me a PIII 866 still seems like a pretty decent machine!</p>
