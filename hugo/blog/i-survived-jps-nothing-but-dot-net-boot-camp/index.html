			<h1>I Survived JP&#39;s Nothing but Dot Net Boot Camp!</h1>
			<div>
				<p>After a big of pleading I got the privilege of being able to attend <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/NothinButNetVancouverBCJune23rd27thTheEmpireLandmarkHotel.aspx">Jean-Paul Boodhoo&rsquo;s Nothing But Dot Net Bootcamp</a>!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>JP is quite well known in the .Net circuit for his passion for development and his pragmatic approach to software design. Typical posts about his course underline that you&rsquo;ll be <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/2007/07/nothin-but-net-or-how-to-justify-ignoring-your-home-life/">giving up your home life</a> for a week. Since I&rsquo;m a bachelor, it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal for me, but I did feel a bit bad for the guys that had wives and kids at home. Our typical day was no shorter than 14 hours, and one lasted 20 hours. This was for a grand total of 80 hours of training in a 5 day span! The crazy part was that the material was flying at you so fast you didn&rsquo;t even get a chance to be tired.</p>
<p>What I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for was how inspirational JP can be. Not just as a developer but as a person. Not only did he feed us enough developer fundamentals, he also provided management tips, and inspirational stories and references. He shed a new light on what it means to be a developer. I greatly appreciated these tangents, and it has made me think a bit more about what I am trying to accomplish in this world.</p>
<p>The other great takeaway from the course was the great people that attended it. There was a total of 15 of us from all backgrounds and skill levels. Not only were there great programmers, there were some great personalities too. I&rsquo;ll be making sure I keep in touch with all the local developers, and plan on a 6 month re-union with them in the future. I have to give a shout out to <em>Ted</em>, and <em>Peter</em> from <a href="http://andornot.com/">AndOrNot</a> for keeping things entertaining.</p>
<p>This is getting long enough, and I know that trying to write everything that I experienced in the course is next to impossible. I&rsquo;ll probably be referencing skills I learned in the course for quite a while.</p>
<p>If you stumbled upon this post because you are thinking of attending his course, I highly recommend that you do! Even if I had to front my own money for the course I would. It&rsquo;s the best investment you can do for your career.</p>
