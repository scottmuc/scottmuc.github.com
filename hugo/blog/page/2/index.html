It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve posted a &ldquo;life update&rdquo;. The TL;DR is that I have joined Pivotal Cloud Foundry in January and will be moving to Dublin in June.
Reflections on Berlin and SoundCloud My guess is the most frequent question about this is: what happened? When I posted about my decision to move to Berlin and join SoundCloud it appeared that I had found something I really wanted to do.

		This post almost didn&rsquo;t happen. 2015 holds a lot of dead-air from me in the blogging world, but I&rsquo;m so compelled by my routines that I felt that I had to do it! Honouring a self-made routine/tradition is my achilles heel and my biggest strength at the same time.
Reflections on 2015 2015 wasn&rsquo;t a good year for sticking to my goals, but I still learned a lot on the way:

		{% img right /images/blog/chai/08-chai.jpg 300 %} This is the simplest masala chai recipe I know how to make. Compared to the street side chai you would get in India my recipe differs in the fact that mine is less sweet and has a strong black tea and masala flavour (especially the ginger). The wonderful thing about masala chai is that it&rsquo;s easy to adjust to your own taste and it&rsquo;s fun to experiment with.

		This has become a bit of a tradition for me so I can&rsquo;t quite writing these now. This one will be a bit different than the previous ones though. Normally these posts are my technical resolutions. I&rsquo;m not that ambitious anymore when it comes to technical learning so I&rsquo;ve dropped that from the title. Even though I tend to despise meaningless dates, I look at resolutions as one large pomodoro. So the tradition lives on!

Ugh, I left this post until way too late. Unfortunately I&rsquo;ll have to drop a lot of detail as 3 months is pretty hard to sum up in a single blog post. Hopefully I can do it justice as India is a place I&rsquo;m very fond of. I feel bad for all the wonderful little experiences that happened and didn&rsquo;t get written about.

I&rsquo;ve been an off and on jogger for the last 2 years, but my goal is to be a jogger for the rest of my life. For some reason I&rsquo;ve felt compelled to journal my reasons. If one person thinks to take up jogging, then that would be wonderful.
Inspiration The Oatmeal made a fantastic comic of his reasons for running and found that there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap.

	<div>
		The term &ldquo;devops&rdquo; has only existed for 5 years and the trend is to label your tool as a devops tool in order for it to gain traction. When I look at the landscape of tools, most look like Ops tools, just relabeled.
The reason this has been on my mind is that myself and Subhas released a website called Devops Bookmarks to aggregate all the tools in the landscape. Using a Github Pull Request for contributions results in reviewing a lot of tools and after a short amount of time I found myself second-guessing the need for such a website.

I can&rsquo;t say exactly when the job search began. It began with the creation of a Note in Evernote (great tool for this type of task). It was much different than any other job search I&rsquo;ve done, though I haven&rsquo;t done many as I tend to stick to job for at least 4 years at a time. The key difference with this search was that I wasn&rsquo;t working, and wasn&rsquo;t in a hurry to find a job.

Hungary for More (Siófok/Tihany) Remember the woman that I met at the Dream Theater concert? We have kept in touch and she promised to show me around the Hungarian country side! She recommended Balaton Lake area so I found a place to stay in Siófok and worked on scheduling a day to meet up.
Unfortunately the weather did not cooperate as it rained most of the time I was there.

The 2nd assignment in the course is to create a presentation or some form of media to present an understanding of the topics. An accompaniment to the course is the book, A Mind for Numbers by Barbara Oakley (the primary course instructor), which is a short read but very insightful and full of references.
