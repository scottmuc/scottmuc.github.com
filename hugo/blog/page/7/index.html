	<div>
		I cannot believe I&rsquo;ve been at ThoughtWorks for 2 years now! My colleague Aaron Erickson has written an excellent writeup on why (work at) ThoughtWorks. I couldn&rsquo;t agree more!
Reading another colleague&rsquo;s post a while ago inspired me to write a little retrospective of my own. Thanks Rose, you are wise beyond your years!
ThoughtWorks has been a place I wanted to work for since I attended DevTeach in 2007. I met some really smart people who were excellent at articulating their perspective.

No, this is not an April Fools joke. This was something that was actually implemented.
After ThoughtWorks University was over we had a backlog of work items that needed to be done before we all went back to billable work. I wanted to put up a Kanban board with 3 columns (TODO, WIP, DONE) to track the work we needed to do. A question popped into my head; is 3 columns the minimum number necessary?

	<div>
		Lines of code has always been a poor guide in measuring developer productivity. I&rsquo;m currently reading Scott Rosenberg&rsquo;s Dreaming In Code and came across and interesting quote.
 &ldquo;Atkinson [ed: Bill] had just completed rewriting a portion of the Quickdraw code, making it more efficient and faster. The new version was 2000 lines of code shorter than the old one. What to report? He wrote the number -2000&rdquo; &ndash; Rosenberg

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		Every now and then I like to sit in a coffee shop on a Sunday and focus on writing some code. This weekend I had the pleasure of spending this geeky time with a colleague, Chris Ford(twitter).
Chris has gotten me interested into an open source toolkit for creating sounds and making music called Overtone. Here&rsquo;s a talk about demonstrates functional composition using clojure through music and overtone.

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		The one thing that has always annoyed me with installing ruby on Windows is that at some point in time I always need to setup the DevKit because I want to install gems that require native extensions. Also, I want the ability to switch between different versions of ruby.
Introducing Yari yari is a tool (implemented in Powershell) I&rsquo;ve made to simplify both of these operations. Right now it&rsquo;s hard coded to only install the 2 ruby versions I care about right now.

	<div>
		Think about how you get good at anything. What do you remember spending most of your time on? Most likely you spent the majority of your time messing things up and getting it wrong. Why are kids so quick at picking up new skills, especially dangerous ones? It&rsquo;s because kids are fearless experimenters. I&rsquo;m currently learning how to skate and ski and my ability to learn is hindered by my concern of hurting myself; potentially preventing me from working and earning a living.

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		As a publisher for a few Powershell modules I&rsquo;m getting frustrated by the lack of standarization in the community on how to support versioning, deployment and conventions within Powershell module distribution. All I can find is rather adhoc mechanisms of sharing poorly written code with the &ldquo;use at your own risk&rdquo; kinds of disclaimers.
I keep on looking at the ruby community with their amazing tools like rvm, ruby gems, and bundler to make ruby scripting highly testable and repeatable.

	<div>
		The other day I overheard some interns boasting about their complicated shell setup. They felt pretty good about using tmux, zsh, and aliasing the heck out of everything. One of them had to re-map copy and paste because they messed that up, but they felt awesome when they figured out a clever work around.
We&rsquo;ve all been there at some point. It&rsquo;s something that you grow out of over time. At least I hope so.

	<div>
		Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve realized that I&rsquo;m a stubborn mule when it comes to certain aspects of web development. After some internal reflection I&rsquo;ve come up with my top 5 things I strongly feel that I won&rsquo;t compromise on in the web development process. These items are just for the presentation layer, I&rsquo;m loaded with issues deeper into the development stack.
1 - URLs must be as beautiful as possible

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		Ever since I&rsquo;ve begun using NHibernate the number one thing that&rsquo;s caused me a lot of headaches is learning how to properly map my domain objects. Even the most basic mappings I wrote had bugs simple because I overlooked trivial items. This made me realize that I could save a lot of time and hassle if I unit tested by data access layer.
