		{% img left http://www.manning.com/osherove/osherove_cover150.jpg %} In a recent splurge I purchased 4 books from Manning Press with one of them being The Art of Unit Testing by Roy Osherove.
I would categorize myself as relatively new to unit testing. My first hands on testing was when I took the Nothing but .Net bootcamp with JP Boodhoo but he emphasized BDD style tests. I saw the benefit of BDD but didn&rsquo;t feel I had the know how to implement them properly.

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		This is a little late coming but figured I should post anyways. ChefConf 2012 was an amazing event and absolutely surprising considering it&rsquo;s the first conference Opscode has put on. Here are a few things that I noticed:
Culture The attitude and culture around the people there was incredible. Everyone was focused on the needs of the business that they worked for. Sometimes it meant making developers more productive by being to provide consistent environments or by lessening the pain operations have to go through in order to release software created by development teams.

	<div>
		So I&rsquo;ve been getting into the book Getting Things Done lately and can identify with many of the ideas it discusses. The one idea I really like is the consolidation of Inboxes.
I&rsquo;m of the camp that likes to have a pristine desktop. I personally think the desktop should never be seen, and if it is then you&rsquo;re not managing your windows properly. When things go on my desktop I naturally try to clean them up.

	<div>
		DevopsDays is a juxtaposition in the world of IT. Most tech conferences focus on tools and processes, whereas Devops Days focuses on culture and the delivery of value. This year&rsquo;s conference was no exception and here is a summary of what I experienced:
Day 1 The Audubon Society for Partial Failures The first presentation was done by Cliff Moon. He argues that there are many common patterns in the IT space and it would be valuable to have a repository of knowledge that we can visit to read about the types of errors that can happen.

	<div>
		On a previous project, I witnessed a few interesting build breakages that we caught in CI that could have easily gotten passed our automated quality gates. These issues would have hurt us in downstream environments.
It&rsquo;s commonly referenced in the Continuous Delivery book that development environments should be as close to production like as possible. This might not be 100% possible but you can come close. What can come that close is your system integration test environment.

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		Developers like to talk about being in a state of flow. This is when time just seems to fly by and you&rsquo;re writing more code in a few hours than you do in several days when you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;flowing&rdquo;. While I think flowing can be postive, it often can do more harm than good if going on for too long.
In the past I would complain that the environment around me kept me from the flow.

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		Lot of web developement code is spent concatenating path snippets and I always hated having to deal with slashes. I wanted a function that was consistent with its return type, and very loose in its parameter requirements. I ended up with the following:
Test First:
{% gist 1545719 WebPathSpecs.cs %}
The BDD style of testing is inspired (and pretty much copied) from JP Boodhoo&rsquo;s Nothing but .Net class.
Here&rsquo;s the code:

	<div>
		I just read this blog post and it&rsquo;s inspired me to finally post about something that&rsquo;s been in the back of my mind for while now.
Back in the day I used to play 8-ball on a fairly regular basis. I would play with a regular group of friends who would all work on improving our game. One of the players was nearly a professional and provided me one training tip that helps me everyday.

	<div>
		One of the things I love about my job is the ability to see myself grow as a developer. I&rsquo;m glad I can laugh at my old code because if I can&rsquo;t then I&rsquo;m definitely not improving my skillset.
Here&rsquo;s some code from around 3 years ago:
{% gist 1545686 UrlRewriteHandler.cs %}
Here&rsquo;s what the code I used to replace it:
{% gist 1545686 PermalinkProcessingHandler.cs %}

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		I&rsquo;m creating an automated build process and one of the items in the build is to build an external resource which is a java script library. The javascript is contained in multiple files and I want to concatenate them into one script. I found a very useful tool called JS Builder which has a command line executable which I can use to automate the construction of this javascript file.
Setup was very simple.
