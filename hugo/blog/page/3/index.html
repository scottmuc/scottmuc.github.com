		{% img right /images/blog/podcasts/podcast.jpg 300 %} It&rsquo;s quite surprising that I haven&rsquo;t really brought up the topic of podcasts on my blog considering that I&rsquo;ve been consuming them for almost 10 years! My methods and taste have changed a lot over the years. I want a place to point people when asked about what podcasts I listen to, and with a little more context than just a pure list.
Software / Tools A podcast is such a simple concept (from the technical side) that it allows for a lot of tools and applications to be created around the idea.

		Disclaimer - I personally know Manoj and have worked with him in the past. I was asked to review his book, Learning Continuous Integration with TeamCity, by Packt Publishing.
{% img left https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/9518OT%5f0.jpg 200 %} As someone who had spent many years consulting around the benefits of CI and implementing build and release strategies, I was interested in how the minutiae would be brought up in a book.
The book begins by going through the creation and configuration of a similar build process for 3 specific tech stacks: Java, .

Ukraine {% img right /images/blog/career-break/lviv-train.small.jpg 300 %} The next leg of the journey was a long slog from Vienna to L’viv. I took a noon train to Budapest and had to pass some time there for a little while. From Budapest it was an overnight journey with many frequent stops in the middle of the night for immigration and customs. If you’ve ever played Papers, Please, it felt like that.

When in Rome {% img center /images/blog/career-break/rome-fountain.medium.jpg 900 %}
When I learned that my uncle and his family would be in Rome I looked at my schedule to see if I could make seeing them work. It turned out it fit perfectly! The last time I saw them was in London while they were doing their 2013 summer trip and I was on my Belgian Grand Prix vacation.

In the Beginning In 2010 I was on a project that focused on build and release software for a bunch of .Net projects (and a few Java projects). Our &ldquo;glue&rdquo; was written in PowerShell because of the wonderful remoting capabilities and it&rsquo;s integration with Windows automation. Our code was untested and our code base was growing over time because our tools proved to be useful and we were getting more and more feedback.

Prague {% img left /images/blog/career-break/prague.small.jpg 300 %}
Next portion of the trip is to Eastern Europe! I had a nice simple itinerary to Prague: Heidelberg -&gt; Munich -&gt; Prague. Unfortunately something was going on with the brakes on the train and I missed my train in Munich so it turned into: Heidelberg -&gt; Munich -&gt; Neurberg -&gt; Cheb -&gt; Prague. By now I&rsquo;m a seasoned itinerary refactorer so this didn&rsquo;t phase me.

Reunions in Glasgow Since my train didn&rsquo;t leave until after noon, I decided to go back to Bletchley Park and spend the morning there. It was so nice to just spend some idle time in the park and not hurry through the exhibits. Unrushed, I made my way to the train station for a direct train to Glasgow. Upon arrival at the station I was greeted by Derek and Rose who I know from back in the Calgary days.

Shipment Delivered Upon arrival in Antwerp I saw my taxi from the deck. I had all my belongings ready and made my way down to the port. The ship crew was busy with the offloading of containers so I decided it probably wasn’t a good idea to disturb them to say farewell. It was a long drive to the immigration office, and there I found out that I needed a passenger manifest to get the stamp of approval.

		As I mentioned in my last post, I finished the crossing of the Atlantic ocean via container ship. It was a great experiene that I&rsquo;ll happily do again. 11 days wasn&rsquo;t enough, and would be happy to spend a month next time around.
Too Much Twine on my Hands A blog post probably wouldn&rsquo;t due the experience justice so I decided to play around with a basic word game engine to give you a more self-directed tour.

		After another relaxing two weeks in Vancouver (and attending Sasquatch), it&rsquo;s time to leave. Here&rsquo;s the last sunset I watched from the beach. If you can believe it, the weather in Vancouver was 99% rain free!

Schools Out for Summer During my downtime I&rsquo;ve enrolled in the Economics of Banking and Money on Coursera. I never thought I would find learning this stuff so much fun!
