			<h1>Manager Suffixes Are a Code Smell</h1>
			<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
			<div>
				<p>After attending <a href="/blog/development/i-survived-jp-s-nothing-but-dot-net-boot-camp/">Nothing But .Net Bootcamp</a> I noticed none of the classes that were written in the course had a <em>Manager</em> suffix. I&rsquo;ve sort had a eureka moment and have a good idea on why this is.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>JP heavily emphasized the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a> throughout the course. If a class is only has a single responsibility it will be pretty difficult to attach a Manager suffix to the class name.</p>
<p>So often have have I grouped together methods into some sort of &ldquo;Manager&rdquo; class and have always felt guilty about it. Having a Manager class almost corresponds to the <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/fixit.html">Broken Windows story</a>. You start thinking that since you have the Manager class it won&rsquo;t hurt to add another method to it, which is simply giving it more responsibilities.</p>
<p>I think a good real world exercise for me to do is to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring">refactor</a> one of my Manager classes into a set of classes that perform the same operations in a much more cohesive way.</p>
