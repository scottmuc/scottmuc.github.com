			<h1>Handy Web Path Concatenation Code</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Lot of web developement code is spent concatenating path snippets and I always hated having to deal with slashes. I wanted a function that was consistent with its return type, and very loose in its parameter requirements. I ended up with the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Test First</em>:</p>
<p>{% gist 1545719 WebPathSpecs.cs %}</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">BDD</a> style of testing is inspired (and pretty much copied) from JP Boodhoo&rsquo;s Nothing but .Net class.</p>
<p><em>Here&rsquo;s the code</em>:</p>
<p>{% gist 1545719 WebPath.cs %}</p>
<p>That was my first go at it. I have a feeling I might generalize the class to be a delimited string builder. Which would be nice because then the method won&rsquo;t be static. Anyways, just thought I would share something that I think is concise but will be used a lot.</p>
