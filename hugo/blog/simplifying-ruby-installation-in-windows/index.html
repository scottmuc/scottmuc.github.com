			<h1>Simplifying Ruby Installation in Windows</h1>
			<div>
				<p>The one thing that has always annoyed me with installing ruby on Windows is that at some point in time I always need to setup the DevKit because I want to install gems that require native extensions. Also, I want the ability to switch between different versions of ruby.</p>

<h3 id="introducing-yari">Introducing Yari</h3>
<p>yari is a tool (implemented in Powershell) I&rsquo;ve made to simplify both of these operations. Right now it&rsquo;s hard coded to only install the 2 ruby versions I care about right now.</p>
<ul>
<li>1.8.7 so I can play with <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/1/wiki/Puppet_Windows">Puppet</a></li>
<li>1.9.2 to be bleeding edge</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Installation</strong> is described in the readme on the github page. Once installed you can simply run yari from anywhere in the command prompt. Also, you can pass a -InstallMachine argument to yari and it will permanently configure your PATH for the ruby version selected.</p>
<p>So far this tool has made my ruby management in Windows a lot simpler and hopefully it can help you out too. If you find it useful but can use a few changes please submit issues to the projects github page. Or better yet, fork it and submit a pull request.</p>
<p>After installing, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll be able to do (and installing things that require native extensions will work):</p>
