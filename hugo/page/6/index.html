		After attending Nothing But .Net Bootcamp I noticed none of the classes that were written in the course had a Manager suffix. I&rsquo;ve sort had a eureka moment and have a good idea on why this is.
JP heavily emphasized the Single Responsibility Principle throughout the course. If a class is only has a single responsibility it will be pretty difficult to attach a Manager suffix to the class name.

		It&rsquo;s funny how many posts there are from people who have migrated to Octopress. What would motivate someone to post their migration experience? I think I understand why. It&rsquo;s such a shift in thinking that it&rsquo;s worth talking about. My migration experience was so much pleasant that I feel that I must let everyone know.
So what&rsquo;s my motivation for moving to a new blogging platform? Was what I was using before broken?

	<div>
		I&rsquo;ve never made any New Years resolutions before. This year I&rsquo;m going to break that trend simply to create a checklist of tasks to keep me on track. I easily get distracted, but having to check things off a list is a sure way for me to stay focused.
Not wanting to over do it, I made goals that are easily attainable. Hopefully upon completion I&rsquo;ll get more ambitious the next time around.

	<div>
		Looking back at 2010 I can&rsquo;t say I did a good job of following through with my resolutions, but I believe I have a valid excuse! For the last 12 months I&rsquo;ve been working more as a build/release specialist than a software developer. Anyways, here&rsquo;s a rundown of what I didn&rsquo;t accomplish last year:
 Test Driven Design - I barely coded at all so that was a total flop. I also believe that this is something that&rsquo;s hard to do on your own.

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		An interesting thing about 2011 is that my resolutions from earlier became quite prominent. Given that 8 months of 2011 were spent on a large account with less technical focus, I&rsquo;m amazed at some of the technical things that I&rsquo;ve done.
Reflections on 2011 and carry over from 2010:  Mouseless Computing (2010) - I think the practice is paying off as a colleague of mine told me &ldquo;You make Windows fly!

		2012 started off interesting because I was on on an iOS/ruby project. Nearly everything was new to me, but I liked how my past experiences with other technology stacks were still relevant. Even though I didn&rsquo;t know the languages very well the patterns I&rsquo;ve seen before still applied.
The last quarter of the year was spent teaching new software developers in India, which has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career!

		I was tempted to not write this post. My motivations are changing a bit and growing strong technically isn&rsquo;t one of my top priorities nowadays.
Reflections on 2013 Last year was very interesting for me. It&rsquo;s the first time I didn&rsquo;t really have a home. I&rsquo;ve split my time between India, United States, and South Africa, (ok, I was in Toronto for a few weeks too). During that time I&rsquo;ve reflected a lot (probably too much).

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		Hi there and welcome to my demo of Pester, a BDD style testing framework for Powershell. The creation of Pester came out of the desire to test some build/deployment infrastructure we were creating for a project. We wrote nearly all the code without tests and it came to bite us in the end. I wanted to find a way ensure these problems didn&rsquo;t happen again as well as provide some code coverage to give new entrants to the codebase some confidence that they won&rsquo;t break everything.

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		A few months ago I posted a simple tutorial on how to use Pester (a powershell bdd testing framework). I&rsquo;m starting to practice the making of screencasts so I thought I would add some audio/visual to the blog post. I start rambling in the last 5 minutes so I won&rsquo;t feel insulted if you stop paying attention after that part.
Also, I want to thank Manoj Mahalingam and Martin Aatmaa for their feedback and contributions!

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		After a whirlwind of activity on the Pester codebase I&rsquo;m happy to announce the latest release of Pester. Versions 1.2 and 2 are identical feature wise except for one subtle difference that I&rsquo;ll get into soon.
New Expectation and Matcher Syntax In prior versions of Pester, we have the dot notation expectation and matcher syntax
$some_string.should.be(&#34;some value&#34;) This required some clever and downright nasty hacks to the PowerShell runtime. This created a few issues for some users and I wanted to get that fixed.
