		Several months ago someone posted an excellent question on the Pester Group about a certain problem area in testing PowerShell with Pester. He brings up a relevant example of the difficulties that can occur when writing tests is done afterwards. It also reveals a missing feature of Pester.
First let me display the code that needed tests:
{% gist e5abe37881628f13cd0a Get-FromSFtp.ps1 %}
Here are a couple reasons why this code is difficult to test:

		For the last two weeks I&rsquo;ve been house sitting for a friend in the beautiful area of Kitsalano in Vancouver. The goal for the two weeks was to figure out the rest of my travel plans and to meet up with a lot of my friends and acquaintances that I haven&rsquo;t seen for a while.
According to Plan? The two weeks went by quickly. I mainly organized myself around other people&rsquo;s clocks.

	<div>
		For some context, you may want to read my previous post about quitting my job.
I am homeless and unemployed in probably the most priveleged meaning of the terms. Both states of being are choices I&rsquo;ve explicitly made. From what I&rsquo;ve read, I&rsquo;m not really on a sabbatical, but I&rsquo;m on a Career Break, except the homeless aspect of it is not as conventional.
So here are the reflections:
Where Am I Sleeping Tonight On September 1st 2012 I gave up my awesome apartment in Calgary as I prepared for an assignment in India (without really knowing where I was going after that).

		On January 4th 2010 I joined ThoughtWorks and it has been an amazing journey. I&rsquo;ve seen more systems, worked with more people, and seen more countries than the entire 30 years that preceded that date. I still can&rsquo;t believe how lucky I&rsquo;ve been to have such a wonderful opportunity. That&rsquo;s why it took me a long time to decide to leave it, and go on a bit of an adventure.

		Valuable Links for Devops TL;DR - Watch this video and read the 10 myths of DevOps (which also links to what I now find is the best video on devops).
Since I first learned the term devops 4 years ago I&rsquo;ve gone through many leaps in understanding. I really wish I saw this video (history of devops) before I got involved. As a software developer, I find delivering frequently highly motivating.

		As many of you know, I have left CBC Radio 3 and got a position as a Software Consultant with Thoughtworks Calgary. Considering that I have lived my entire life in the lower mainland of BC this is a big change. Not only am I leaving behind many friends and family, a beautiful city, and a great job, I&rsquo;m also leaving behind my golf membership gasp. At least with the Internet, it&rsquo;s easy to remain in touch and this blog is one of the many ways I&rsquo;ll be keeping in touch.

		After a big of pleading I got the privilege of being able to attend Jean-Paul Boodhoo&rsquo;s Nothing But Dot Net Bootcamp!
JP is quite well known in the .Net circuit for his passion for development and his pragmatic approach to software design. Typical posts about his course underline that you&rsquo;ll be giving up your home life for a week. Since I&rsquo;m a bachelor, it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal for me, but I did feel a bit bad for the guys that had wives and kids at home.

		Matt Hamilton wrote an excellent blog post about something that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for a long time. As a developer you want to keep improving, but the more you know the more choices that appear.
When first coding projects that require database access you get used to learning the SqlCommand class and have nested using statements to retrieve your readers. Next thing you learn is strong typed DataSets and then you move on to ORMs and code generators.

		For the last 7 years I&rsquo;ve been running a FreeBSD server at home for all my file serving needs. It&rsquo;s always been solid and never caused problems. It was the gateway into Unix knowledge for me and I loved the whole experience. A fellow 8-ball competitor revealed that he&rsquo;s a sales agent for Microsoft and kindly gave me an OEM copy of Windows Home Server (WHS)! I reluctantly decided to retire the ol BSD box and try out WHS.

	<time>01.01.0001 00:00</time>
	
	<div>
		For a while now I&rsquo;ve been waiting for something that can be as close to ruby gems as possible for PowerShell. For a while I thought Nuget was the way but it&rsquo;s tight coupling to Visual Studio made it feel like it wasn&rsquo;t quite the right fit for PowerShell.
Mike Chaliy has made probably what could be called the simplest thing that could possibly work, and it works well! It&rsquo;s called PsGet (not to be confused with another project called PsGet).
