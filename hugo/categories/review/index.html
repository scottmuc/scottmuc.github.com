		{% img left /images/blog/l2l/book.jpg 200 %} Over the last 4 weeks I&rsquo;ve been taking the Coursera course Learning how to Learn on the recommendation of my friend Srini. The 2nd assignment in the course is to create a presentation or some form of media to present an understanding of the topics.
