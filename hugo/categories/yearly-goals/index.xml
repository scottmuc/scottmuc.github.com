      <description>Reflections on 2018 This will be easy because I didn’t set any goals last year! It felt great to take a break from goal setting because 2018 was a big year of transition. I moved yet again and I started a new role at work. I then found that it didn’t fit me and I finally had some self awareness to reach out for help and was able to switch roles again to something that suits me at this moment in time.</description>

      <description>Reflections on 2017  Perform 1 pull up - This didn&amp;rsquo;t go so well. I&amp;rsquo;m now the heaviest that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been (95kg). My psoriasis (scalp) has become really annoying and gets worse when I exercise. So 2017 wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good year for my health. It&amp;rsquo;s very clear that I don&amp;rsquo;t handle disruption of my routine very well. Below is a graph of my workouts:  {% img center /images/blog/workouts-2017.png 1024 %}</description>

      <description>2016 was the first time I accomplished my goal!
Reflections on 2016  Write in a Journal - This one I am marking as a success. Here are the (manually) calculated stats:  Jan 9 Feb 3 Mar 12 Apr 9 May 15 Jun 9 Jul 13 Aug 14 Sep 12 Oct 14 Nov 9 Dec 12 I wrote 143 journal entries over the course of 2016. After counting them all up there are far fewer than I thought, but the frequency is actually more consistent than I thought.</description>

      <description>This post almost didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. 2015 holds a lot of dead-air from me in the blogging world, but I&amp;rsquo;m so compelled by my routines that I felt that I had to do it! Honouring a self-made routine/tradition is my achilles heel and my biggest strength at the same time.
Reflections on 2015 2015 wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good year for sticking to my goals, but I still learned a lot on the way:</description>

      <description>This has become a bit of a tradition for me so I can&amp;rsquo;t quite writing these now. This one will be a bit different than the previous ones though. Normally these posts are my technical resolutions. I&amp;rsquo;m not that ambitious anymore when it comes to technical learning so I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped that from the title. Even though I tend to despise meaningless dates, I look at resolutions as one large pomodoro. So the tradition lives on!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never made any New Years resolutions before. This year I&amp;rsquo;m going to break that trend simply to create a checklist of tasks to keep me on track. I easily get distracted, but having to check things off a list is a sure way for me to stay focused.
Not wanting to over do it, I made goals that are easily attainable. Hopefully upon completion I&amp;rsquo;ll get more ambitious the next time around.</description>

      <description>Looking back at 2010 I can&amp;rsquo;t say I did a good job of following through with my resolutions, but I believe I have a valid excuse! For the last 12 months I&amp;rsquo;ve been working more as a build/release specialist than a software developer. Anyways, here&amp;rsquo;s a rundown of what I didn&amp;rsquo;t accomplish last year:
 Test Driven Design - I barely coded at all so that was a total flop. I also believe that this is something that&amp;rsquo;s hard to do on your own.</description>

      <description>An interesting thing about 2011 is that my resolutions from earlier became quite prominent. Given that 8 months of 2011 were spent on a large account with less technical focus, I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at some of the technical things that I&amp;rsquo;ve done.
Reflections on 2011 and carry over from 2010:  Mouseless Computing (2010) - I think the practice is paying off as a colleague of mine told me &amp;ldquo;You make Windows fly!</description>

      <description>2012 started off interesting because I was on on an iOS/ruby project. Nearly everything was new to me, but I liked how my past experiences with other technology stacks were still relevant. Even though I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the languages very well the patterns I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before still applied.
The last quarter of the year was spent teaching new software developers in India, which has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career!</description>

      <description>I was tempted to not write this post. My motivations are changing a bit and growing strong technically isn&amp;rsquo;t one of my top priorities nowadays.
Reflections on 2013 Last year was very interesting for me. It&amp;rsquo;s the first time I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a home. I&amp;rsquo;ve split my time between India, United States, and South Africa, (ok, I was in Toronto for a few weeks too). During that time I&amp;rsquo;ve reflected a lot (probably too much).</description>
