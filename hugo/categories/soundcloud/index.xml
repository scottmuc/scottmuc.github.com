It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted a &amp;ldquo;life update&amp;rdquo;. The TL;DR is that I have joined Pivotal Cloud Foundry in January and will be moving to Dublin in June.
Reflections on Berlin and SoundCloud My guess is the most frequent question about this is: what happened? When I posted about my decision to move to Berlin and join SoundCloud it appeared that I had found something I really wanted to do.</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t say exactly when the job search began. It began with the creation of a Note in Evernote (great tool for this type of task). It was much different than any other job search I&amp;rsquo;ve done, though I haven&amp;rsquo;t done many as I tend to stick to job for at least 4 years at a time. The key difference with this search was that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a hurry to find a job.</description>
