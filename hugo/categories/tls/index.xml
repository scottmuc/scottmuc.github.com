      <description>This is embarassing to admit but I have to re-learn Transport Layer Security (TLS) on a continuous basis. This post is my cheatsheet to remembering all the itty bitty details, which I&amp;rsquo;ll forgot shortly after I do whatever TLS related task I have on my plate.
What&amp;rsquo;s TLS you ask? Take 9 minutes to listen to this fantastic episode on Public key cryptography which will prime (hah!) you up for the rest of the post.</description>
