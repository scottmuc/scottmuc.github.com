Ugh, I left this post until way too late. Unfortunately I&rsquo;ll have to drop a lot of detail as 3 months is pretty hard to sum up in a single blog post. Hopefully I can do it justice as India is a place I&rsquo;m very fond of. I feel bad for all the wonderful little experiences that happened and didn&rsquo;t get written about.

I can&rsquo;t say exactly when the job search began. It began with the creation of a Note in Evernote (great tool for this type of task). It was much different than any other job search I&rsquo;ve done, though I haven&rsquo;t done many as I tend to stick to job for at least 4 years at a time. The key difference with this search was that I wasn&rsquo;t working, and wasn&rsquo;t in a hurry to find a job.

Hungary for More (Siófok/Tihany) Remember the woman that I met at the Dream Theater concert? We have kept in touch and she promised to show me around the Hungarian country side! She recommended Balaton Lake area so I found a place to stay in Siófok and worked on scheduling a day to meet up.
Unfortunately the weather did not cooperate as it rained most of the time I was there.

Ukraine {% img right /images/blog/career-break/lviv-train.small.jpg 300 %} The next leg of the journey was a long slog from Vienna to L’viv. I took a noon train to Budapest and had to pass some time there for a little while. From Budapest it was an overnight journey with many frequent stops in the middle of the night for immigration and customs. If you’ve ever played Papers, Please, it felt like that.

When in Rome {% img center /images/blog/career-break/rome-fountain.medium.jpg 900 %}
When I learned that my uncle and his family would be in Rome I looked at my schedule to see if I could make seeing them work. It turned out it fit perfectly! The last time I saw them was in London while they were doing their 2013 summer trip and I was on my Belgian Grand Prix vacation.

Prague {% img left /images/blog/career-break/prague.small.jpg 300 %}
Next portion of the trip is to Eastern Europe! I had a nice simple itinerary to Prague: Heidelberg -&gt; Munich -&gt; Prague. Unfortunately something was going on with the brakes on the train and I missed my train in Munich so it turned into: Heidelberg -&gt; Munich -&gt; Neurberg -&gt; Cheb -&gt; Prague. By now I&rsquo;m a seasoned itinerary refactorer so this didn&rsquo;t phase me.

Reunions in Glasgow Since my train didn&rsquo;t leave until after noon, I decided to go back to Bletchley Park and spend the morning there. It was so nice to just spend some idle time in the park and not hurry through the exhibits. Unrushed, I made my way to the train station for a direct train to Glasgow. Upon arrival at the station I was greeted by Derek and Rose who I know from back in the Calgary days.

Shipment Delivered Upon arrival in Antwerp I saw my taxi from the deck. I had all my belongings ready and made my way down to the port. The ship crew was busy with the offloading of containers so I decided it probably wasn’t a good idea to disturb them to say farewell. It was a long drive to the immigration office, and there I found out that I needed a passenger manifest to get the stamp of approval.

		As I mentioned in my last post, I finished the crossing of the Atlantic ocean via container ship. It was a great experiene that I&rsquo;ll happily do again. 11 days wasn&rsquo;t enough, and would be happy to spend a month next time around.
Too Much Twine on my Hands A blog post probably wouldn&rsquo;t due the experience justice so I decided to play around with a basic word game engine to give you a more self-directed tour.

		After another relaxing two weeks in Vancouver (and attending Sasquatch), it&rsquo;s time to leave. Here&rsquo;s the last sunset I watched from the beach. If you can believe it, the weather in Vancouver was 99% rain free!

Schools Out for Summer During my downtime I&rsquo;ve enrolled in the Economics of Banking and Money on Coursera. I never thought I would find learning this stuff so much fun!
