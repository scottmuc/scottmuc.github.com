		For the last two weeks I&rsquo;ve been house sitting for a friend in the beautiful area of Kitsalano in Vancouver. The goal for the two weeks was to figure out the rest of my travel plans and to meet up with a lot of my friends and acquaintances that I haven&rsquo;t seen for a while.
According to Plan? The two weeks went by quickly. I mainly organized myself around other people&rsquo;s clocks.

		For some context, you may want to read my previous post about quitting my job.
I am homeless and unemployed in probably the most priveleged meaning of the terms. Both states of being are choices I&rsquo;ve explicitly made. From what I&rsquo;ve read, I&rsquo;m not really on a sabbatical, but I&rsquo;m on a Career Break, except the homeless aspect of it is not as conventional.
So here are the reflections:

		On January 4th 2010 I joined ThoughtWorks and it has been an amazing journey. I&rsquo;ve seen more systems, worked with more people, and seen more countries than the entire 30 years that preceded that date. I still can&rsquo;t believe how lucky I&rsquo;ve been to have such a wonderful opportunity. That&rsquo;s why it took me a long time to decide to leave it, and go on a bit of an adventure.
