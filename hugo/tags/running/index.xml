      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been an off and on jogger for the last 2 years, but my goal is to be a jogger for the rest of my life. For some reason I&amp;rsquo;ve felt compelled to journal my reasons. If one person thinks to take up jogging, then that would be wonderful.&#xA;Inspiration The Oatmeal made a fantastic comic of his reasons for running and found that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of overlap. Of course I don&amp;rsquo;t run ultra marathons, nor have I been running for a decade, but I find this comic inspirational and I look at it every couple months.</description>
