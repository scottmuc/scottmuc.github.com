		First Off - Introducing Valuable Links Today I&rsquo;ve decided to start something new. I tend to send my friends and colleagues links about all sorts of things. Usually when they are pertinent to a problem they are having, or to supplement a conversation I&rsquo;ve had with them.

Also, when I share my links I tend to write a few sentences about them.
