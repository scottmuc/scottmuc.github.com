<h3>Ukraine</h3>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-train.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-train.small.jpg" width="300"></a>
The next leg of the journey was a long slog from Vienna to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv">L’viv</a>. I took a noon train to Budapest and had to pass
some time there for a little while. From Budapest it was an overnight journey with many frequent stops in the
middle of the night for immigration and customs. If you’ve ever played <a href="http://papersplea.se/">Papers, Please</a>, it felt like that. Ukraine
isn’t part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement">Schengen agreement</a> so you can’t just cross the border without a documents check. Around a few
hours from L’viv the attendant asks me about my purpose in Ukraine. She then points at my “ringless” ring finger and
smiles. I knew of the Russian/Ukrainian bride thing, but found it crazy that her first guess was for that purpose.
I thought it was a hyped up, but after watching a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wW7c58nMI4">youtube documentaries</a> about it, I learned
it’s sadly alive and well.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-train2.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-train2.small.jpg" width="300"></a>
Even with such a long journey the train pretty much arrived on time within a couple minutes. When I exited the train I
immediately could recognize my cousin <a href="https://twitter.com/RusalkaUA">Lilia</a>. She ran up to me and gave me a proper family style hug. Looks like I’m
home! We took a bus to her home in the Northern part of the city. I was introduced to her roommate,
<a href="https://twitter.com/uPadavan">Vitalik</a>. He and I got along really well. He’s a web designer and looks to have a knack for it!
Lilia had to go back to work so I unpacked
and made myself at home. Later that evening Lilia’s sister, Natalia, arrived by train from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternopil">Ternopil</a>. She had a huge
package of food from her parents and we all enjoyed a feast as I did my best to tell the story  myself and the Myц family
history in Canada.</p>

<h2>L&#8217;viv</h2>

<p>I felt immediately comfortable in L’viv. As Lilia was at work, Vitalek and Natalia guided me around the city. Here
are some of the noteworthy places we checked out:</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-high-castle.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-high-castle.small.jpg" width="190" title="&#34;High Castle&#34;" alt="&#34;High Castle&#34;"></a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv_High_Castle">High Castle</a> &ndash; On my first day in L&#8217;viv I was antsy to go out and explore. I never feel comfortable
  in a location until I spend at least a whole day walking around exploring and knowing my surroundings. Natalia likes
  to sleep in (she&rsquo;s going to kill me), so instead of waiting for her to wake up, I decide to explore L&#8217;viv on my own.
  The high castle name is more of a memory as the castle isn&rsquo;t there anymore. Getting to the top of the hill was
  good exercise and rewarded me with a beautiful 360 degree view of the city.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-dim-legend.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-dim-legend.small.jpg" width="190" title="&#34;Dim Legend&#34;" alt="&#34;Dim Legend&#34;"></a>
<a href="http://ukraineallaboutu.com/travel-in-ukraine/hotels-and-restaurants/lviv/house-of-legends/">Dim Legend (House of Legend)</a> &ndash; There are a collection of restaurants owned by a company that&rsquo;s doing some interesting
  setups. Dim Legend has a room for every story (or a story for every room). The restaurant takes
  the entire building and you can go up to the roof top where there&rsquo;s patio with a car, and a chimney with a ladder so
  that you can climb to the top. There&rsquo;s something refreshing about being in a country that doesn&rsquo;t have the same
  restrictive safety regulations of most western countries.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-rynok.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-rynok.small.jpg" width="190" title="&#34;Rynok Square&#34;" alt="&#34;Rynok Square&#34;"></a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Square_(Lviv)">Rynok Square</a> &ndash; Like most Eastern European cities, L&#8217;viv has a beautiful (albeit touristy) city
  square. You&rsquo;ll find the &ldquo;floating&rdquo; statue people and dudes making giant bubbles. Overall though, the atmosphere is
  quaint and relaxing. Ukrainian culture is inviting so it&rsquo;s pretty hard to feel like you&rsquo;re too far out of place.
  This is probably where I spent the most time as all the coffee shops and restaurants are all near this location.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-chocolate-chili.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-chocolate-chili.small.jpg" width="190" title="&#34;Melted Chocolate with Chili&#34;" alt="&#34;Melted Chocolate with Chili&#34;"></a>
<a href="http://ukraineallaboutu.com/travel-in-ukraine/hotels-and-restaurants/lviv/lviv-handmade-chocolate/">Lviv chocolate</a> &ndash; One of the most unique experiences I had in L&#8217;viv was drinking melted chocolate
  flavoured with a whole whack load of chili powder! This place was not good for any thought about losing weight. Not
  sure how everyone here stays so fit! At least I was getting a lot of walking in, but not sure if it&rsquo;s enough for
  all the sweets I&rsquo;ve been having.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lvivbeermuseum.com/uk/muzey">Lviv brewery</a> &ndash; On my own I stopped by the brewpub to sample a few of their beers. I was really
intrigued by the style of beer they make there. In general, I found Ukrainian beer sweeter than most beers I&rsquo;ve
had around the world. I visited the brewery a second time with Natalia and Vitalik. We took a brewery tour but
it was done in Ukrainian. I&rsquo;ve never heard Ukrainian spoken so fast, but it was pretty comprehensive. She started
the tour talking about the origins of beer in Egypt.</li>
<li><a href="http://trumitlu.virtual.ua/?lang=en">Try Mitly (3 Brooms)</a> &ndash; My cousins are huge Harry Potter fans and they said that there&rsquo;s a place to have
butter beer in L&#8217;viv! A lot of places were kitschy but that didn&rsquo;t bother me in this environment. I found them a lot
of fun. It could be that I felt like I was in an environment where people aren&rsquo;t as judgemental about such kinds
of establishments.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.justlviv.it/en/1714/gas-lamp.html">Gas lamp</a> &ndash; Owned by the same person as Dim Legend, this restaurant had a unique feel for every floor
and was a fun environment to take some time and relax in.</li>
<li><a href="http://visittoukraine.com/en/unique-ukraine/lviv-coffee-mine">Lviv coffee manufacture</a> &ndash; L&#8217;viv is the coffee capital of Ukraine. Normally tea is the hot beverage
choice, but here coffee rules. A proper L&#8217;viv coffee is hot water mixed with the coffee grounds without a filter.
You wait a few minutes and the grounds settle to the bottom and you&rsquo;re left with a rich, flavourful cup of coffee.
The best part is that you don&rsquo;t need any fancy expensive equipment to make it! It&rsquo;s really the quality of the beans
that matter.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychakiv_Cemetery">Lychakiv Cemetery</a> &ndash; I wanted to go somewhere outside the center and old gothic cemeteries seem to appeal
to me for some reason. The day that I visited Lychakiv Cemetery was sunny and warm. The whole area is like a maze and
it was nice to wander around witnessing the beautiful scenery.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/lviv-tram.jpg" width="70">
L&#8217;viv is a city rich in culture, architecture, and friendly people. It&rsquo;s accessible with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trams_in_Lviv">120 year old tram</a>
system, but remember to punch your ticket yourself (pictures to the left) and has all the things you need as a traveler.
The city is sort of a dream land for me. It has excellent beer, chocolate, coffee, books, and food. The people are
friendly and accomodating, I can&rsquo;t wait to be back!</p>

<h2>Ternopil</h2>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/ternopil-home.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/ternopil-home.small.jpg" width="200"></a>
For the weekend, Lillia had planned a trip to Ternopil to visit her parents and other relatives. Apparently they don’t
get many foreigners on the train and the attendant on the train made an effort to ask if I wanted tea or coffee in
English. He sort of chuckled and so did my cousins, not sure why. We took a bus from the train station to the outer area of Ternopil
where Lilias’s parents live. It was a classic pre 90’s looking apartment block. The door opens to their apartment and
I’m welcomed with a feast on the table! Lilia’s parents didn’t speak much English so poor Lilia had to spend a lot of
time translating (she eventually could tell me whole life story without me having to say a word). The meal started with
a shot of vodka. When Ivan offered me another, I replied “tak, bud laska!” (translation: yes, please!). That moment
signified me as an authentic family member.</p>

<p>First, I need to digress and talk about Lilia and Natalia’s parents, Ivan and Mariia. They are the sweetest couple and
so generous. I loved how they didn’t let the language barrier prevent us from getting to know each other. One of my
favourite moments was sitting with Ivan as he showed me pictures and we had a conversation. Lilia was busy packing
for the trip back and after she was done she asked what the heck we could possibly talk about. I’m not quite sure
myself, but we laughed a lot and didn’t let language stop us from at least trying to communicate. We even enjoyed
watching the Belgian GP (and what an awesome race!) with some Ukrainian craft beers. One day I hope to learn more
Ukrainian so we can communicate even more the next time we meet.</p>

<p>Mariia could easily be mistaken as a sister of her daughters. She’s actually my
cousin (Lilia and Natalia are my 2nd cousins 1st removed) and the family bond was definitely felt. She’s also an
amazing cook! The meals included home made: cabbage rolls, varenyky (perogies), shkvarky (pork rind), sour cream, borscht, milk, and juice.
I’m pretty sure I gained 5 kilos over those few days.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/ternopil-beer1.jpg" width="180">
<img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/ternopil-beer2.jpg" width="180">
The next day was spent driving to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velyki_Birky">Velyki Birky</a>, a village outside of Ternopil. Our first stop was at Mariia’s parents (Hanna and
Fedoz). First we stopped by a house which was a family run brewery (business card pictured). One of the sons of the owner was there and he
happily (in excellent English) explained the whole operation. The beer was fresh, un-pasterized, un-filtered, and
very tasty. We then arrived and had a big family lunch (with more shots of vodka). Hanna is my dad’s cousin as she
is the daughter of Eve Myц who is the sister of Petro Myц, my dad’s father. The meal was of course fantastic and I
did my best to update them on my family back in Canada. During the afternoon, Lilia, Natalia, and I walked over to
where Hanna&rsquo;s other children live. Lilia gave her best rendition of my life story and we had fun playing more Q&amp;A
with more of my family. One of the big questions was on how Canada was receiving the news about the events going
on in Ukraine. Unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t quite adequatley answer the question but from a generalized perspective I
could say that the West has been pretty weak in it&rsquo;s response.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/ternopil-family.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/ternopil-family.medium.jpg" width="510"></a>

<p>In the evening I went out with the girls to meet up with some of their friends. It was fun introducing them to some
of the games I played at TWU (eg: numbers game, and one-up one-down). The next day was a holiday for independence day
so we went walking around the city for a bit. The city had some very pretty areas and some interesting looking playgrounds.
After our walk we went to the train station (pic: don&rsquo;t we look like an intimidating group?).</p>

<h2>Back to L&#8217;viv</h2>

<p>After an amazing weekend we headed back to L&#8217;viv. Lilia&rsquo;s roommate was returning so I had find a <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/451524">place of my own</a>
to for a few days. I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for how much I would miss being in the same place as my cousins and Vitalik (I&rsquo;m
considering him family). I did feel some sense of relief to give Lilia some time without having to worry
about entertaining me and it gave me a chance to practice my Ukrainian all on my own. The few days I spent on my
own was focused on hanging out in coffee shops and working on a browser plugin. I realized there&rsquo;s a reason why
people smiled when I asked for the wifi password when I hung out at a venue. Trying to be Ukrainian I would say
&ldquo;Internet bud laska&rdquo;. This is the equivalent of ordering the Internet off of a menu. My cousins got a good laugh
from this, and apparently so did all the wait staff I said this to.</p>

<p>Anyways, over a couple days I got the the basic functionality of a plugin working called <a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/blockworthy">BlockWorthy</a>.
It scrubs links to viral websites and issues you a warning if you happen to go to one of those websites. It felt good
to be writing some code and exploring some ideas.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Leaving Ukraine I thought about the bond of family. I had been watching Game of Thrones and seeing how important
bloodlines are in that show probably had some affect on me. I was really touched that my cousins would openly accept
me into their home and all because we share common ancestry (my great grandfater, their great great grandfather).
I didn’t even know who were my cousins were until my aunt
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biggar,_Saskatchewan">Biggar</a> informed me there are relatives in Ukraine who would love to meet me. The thought about the subconscious
bond with family made me think about why we have countries and lines on maps. It’s like a higher level view of the
bond. Patriotism is like a larger version of nepotism. I can’t help connect more easily with someone from Canada than
I would USA. My bond with my cousins exists because of who my parents are. My ability to nearly walk into any country
is simply because of the country I was born in.</p>

<p>What I’m really trying to say is that I’m so freaking lucky to be born into an awesome family and country. Because
of these uncontrollable events (on my part), I’ve been afforded so many luxuries.</p>

    <link href="http://scottmuc.com/rome-switzerland-and-vienna/"/>

    <id>http://scottmuc.com/rome-switzerland-and-vienna</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>July 30th &ndash; August 17th</em></p>

<h2>When in Rome</h2>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/rome-fountain.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/rome-fountain.medium.jpg" width="900"></a></p>

<p>When I learned that my uncle and his family would be in Rome I looked at my schedule to see if I could make seeing them
work. It turned out it fit perfectly! The last time I saw them was in London while they were doing their 2013 summer
trip and I was on my Belgian Grand Prix vacation. My aunt and uncle are well versed in the world of business so we had
many evenings discussing what I&rsquo;ve learned from the economics courses and floating ideas of what&rsquo;s next for my life. Of
course I got to catch up with my cousins too. Can&rsquo;t believe how quickly they are growing up (I won&rsquo;t mention that I
remember seeing them in diapers to avoid their embarassment).  They had rented a flat near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Steps">Spanish Steps</a>
which made it easy for me to cram in a bunch of sight-seeing in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Touring Rome is pretty easy because all you have to do is step outside. Even on my first walk I stumbled across many
interersting sites. I did a couple free walking tours, but they weren&rsquo;t organized by Sandeman and weren&rsquo;t nearly the
same quality. Still, it was good to have a guided walk to the Colloseum and to the Vatican. My favourite place was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gallery_of_Maps">Hallway of Maps</a> in the Vatican Museum. Ever since I was a kid, I&rsquo;ve always loved looking at maps. On
roadtrips I would be the navigator, and my favourite thing about Ultima VII is the cloth map that was packaged with the
game</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/rome-colosseum.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/rome-colosseum.small.jpg" width="335"></a>
<a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/rome-square.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/rome-square.small.jpg" width="335"></a>
<a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/rome-st-peters.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/rome-st-peters.small.jpg" width="335"></a></p>

<p>As beautiful as Rome was, I knew my time as a tourist was ending. I was at the point where I didn&rsquo;t want to elbow my
way through tourists anymore. Nor was I as interested as I was before in exploring musuems and historical places. The
brain can only hold so much. One thing I enjoyed immensely were the flavour of the tomatoes! Every meal I had I was sure
to have tomatoes as a part of it.</p>

<h2>Watching Time Go By in Switzerland</h2>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/swiss-home.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/swiss-home.medium.jpg" width="900"></a></p>

<p>The other part that made Rome convenient was that I could travel to Switzerland to meet up with fellow ex-ThoughtWork
<a href="https://twitter.com/mhoefi">Marc Hofer</a>, who I worked with in India in ThoughtWorks University (TWU), and who&rsquo;s balcony view is displayed above.
He had a 1L bottle of scotch ready (we numbed our heads with scotch nearly every evening during TWU). Thankfully he was
generous enough to give me a couch for as long as I needed one. I ended up spending 10 days in beautiful <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/thun.html">Thun</a>!</p>

<p>Over the those days I did the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dinners and chats with Marc</strong> &ndash; Catching up with Marc was a lot of fun. During the day I would accrue a lot of ideas and
he became my wall to bounce them off of. One such idea was my new currency that I called &ldquo;Sunset&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a time based
currency where you determine the exchange rate of the base amount which is a Day. If your daily expenses are $100USD,
then that&rsquo;s the exchange rate into Days. If you have $1400 in the bank than you have 2 Weeks saved. It&rsquo;s a completely
personal currency because everyone&rsquo;s exchange into Days will be different. We of course
talked about our time in India and software development in Switzerland. We never really lacked of things to talk about
the whole time I was there.</li>
<li><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/swiss-bern.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/swiss-bern.small.jpg" width="300"></a> <strong>Bern
Excursion</strong> &ndash; Marc had a meetup with some of his colleagues and invited me out. I took a train out to Bern a few
hours before the meetup started so I could wander around a bit. It didn&rsquo;t take long for me to find the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindlifresserbrunnen">Kindlifresserbrunnen (Child Eater Fountain)</a> which is probably the most bizarre statue I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The old
town was beautiful (like Antwerp, Bruges, Heidelberg, Prague, etc&hellip;) and of course I found a nearby
<a href="http://www.altestramdepot.ch/htm/home.htm">brewery</a> to quench my thirst for a bit before heading to meet up with Marc and his colleagues.</li>
<li><strong>Coffee shops</strong> &ndash; During the day I looked to find cafes to hang out in and work on my blog (these posts seem to take me a
heck of a lot of time). There was <a href="https://plus.google.com/106555922181396502598/about?hl=en">one cafe</a> that I really liked. The staff were friendly, played good music, and the
coffee and beers available were very tasty. During this period I was getting working on my <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/scottmuc">CV</a> and getting
excited about working again!</li>
<li><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/swiss-bike.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/swiss-bike.small.jpg" width="300"></a> <strong>Bike
around Lake Thun</strong> &ndash; The weather was hit-and-miss, but for one day there was excellent weather. I rented a bike and
rode it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlaken">Interlaken</a> and back to Thun for a total of 60km. It was a beautiful ride, but I could feel that I&rsquo;m a bit
out of shape.</li>
<li><strong>Train tour</strong> &ndash; There were spare days on my Eurail pass so I decided to check out all the main city centers in the
country. I started by going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva">Geneva</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich">Zurich</a>, and finished in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucerne">Luzern</a>.
Mike Wong, a ThoughtWorker from SF, was on vacation and we met up for dinner. Seriously, ThoughtWorkers are everywhere!</li>
<li><strong>Oberhofen Castle and Clock Museum</strong> &ndash; Over the weekend Marc played tourist with me and we headed over to Oberhofen. The
purpose of the trip was to go the <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/museum-of-clocks-and-mechanical-musical-instruments.html">clock museum</a> but it didn&rsquo;t open for a few hours. We walked around and decided to
tour the <a href="http://www.schlossoberhofen.ch/en/home">castle</a>. After a bit of walking and a quick snack we went back to the clock museum. They
didn&rsquo;t do tours in English so Marc played translator. Even in Swiss-German it was a fun tour. The guide was clearly
passionate about the watches and the music devices.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/swiss-spiez.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/swiss-spiez.small.jpg" width="335"></a>

<p>Since I was in the land of clocks I was hoping to purchase a watch there. Something to be a symbol of taking time to
enjoy life (a principle of my career break) and something to keep me from looking at my phone for the time. I was
inspired by the intricate work that goes into making a watch and thought having one on my wrist would remind me to take
pride in my work and take the necessary time to do it well. Unfortunately all the watch stores were posh and displayed
ideas around prestige and fashion more than engineering. It switched off my idea of purchasing a watch for now.</p>

It was hard to leave Switzerland because I was growing comfortable there. The people were friendly and forgiving of my
inability to speak any of the 4 official languages. Then again, paying over $30 (0.3 Days) was quickly draining my money
reserves. At least the best part of Switzerland is free; the scenery. Oh, and I also like how the currency folded nicely
in my money clip. The notes are sized in such a way that the denomination of the note aligns in such a way that you can
see all of your notes when folded! I can&rsquo;t say how many times I&rsquo;ve had a roll of US notes and found that they were all
$1 bills and I only had a total of $30 on me.</p>

<h2>Composing my Thoughts in Vienna</h2>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/vienna-cats.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/vienna-cats.medium.jpg" width="900"></a></p>

<p>The next leg of my journey is a long train trip to L&#8217;viv, Ukraine. I decided to break up the trip with a stop in Vienna
for a couple days. With only a couple days I had to pack in the sight-seeing. This was made easier with me being
museumed-out so I was mostly checking things out from the outside. To make things easy, I found a
<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1531563">great location</a> with a host with a couple cats (pictured above).</p>

<p>My first day was spent checking out the two largest palaces in Vienna. The highlight was a stop at a <a href="http://www.salmbraeu.com/index.php?id=2&amp;L=1">brewery</a> just
outside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvedere_(palace)">Belvedere</a> palace. The service was great, the food yummy, and every beer tasty. After 1.5L of beer I was set
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace">Schönbrunn</a> palace. I took the metro there and climb up the hill to Gloriette and had a little nap on the grass there.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/vienna-belvedere.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/vienna-belvedere.small.jpg" width="335"></a>
<a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/vienna-schunbrunn.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/vienna-schunbrunn.small.jpg" width="335"></a>
<a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/vienna-center.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/vienna-center.small.jpg" width="335"></a></p>

<p>The next day I used a city bike rental. I&rsquo;m glad I did because I saw a very different Vienna. First stop was to checkout
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundertwasser_Haus">Hundertwasserhaus</a>. It was so interesting and pretty that I wondered why beautiful buildings
like it had to be the exception to the rule. His <a href="http://www.hundertwasser.com/">website</a> is full of interesting ideas. His 5-skins
concept is one I find myself conflicted about. I wonder what it would have been like to have him and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> had a conversation.</p>

<p>I then went through <a href="http://www.wien-vienna.com/prater.php">Prater</a> which was a scary amusement park. The weather was a bit gloomy and there were some
giant clown shaped buildings that made me think of the book IT.</p>

<p>Since I was on a bike I could cover
a bit more distance so I went towards the bridge and crossed North to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donau_City">Donaucity</a>. It was like riding into a dystopian
story! The streets were stark and there was a cold feeling to the area. I rode away to the nearby park and found it odd
to see such a large expanse of greenery vacant on a Saturday afternoon. It reminded me again that big design up front
for cities does not work. What you end up with is something functional but complete devoid of any human feel. After
riding back to the center I parked the bike at another area and checked out another <a href="http://www.1516brewingcompany.com/cms/">brewery</a>. I think I
went there during shift change because it took a long time to get the attention of a waitress. The beer and the currywurst was really
good, but the poor service at the obnoxious sounding Australian behind me (probably was just my mood) was wearing me
down and I took the metro back to the apartment and hung out in the flat with Roman and his cats.</p>

<p>After one more sleep it&rsquo;s time for me to leave Vienna and head to L&#8217;viv, Ukraine!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester"><img src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/github-pester.png"></a></p>

<h3>In the Beginning</h3>

<p>In 2010 I was on a project that focused on build and release software for a bunch of .Net projects (and a few Java
projects). Our &ldquo;glue&rdquo; was written in PowerShell because of the wonderful remoting capabilities and it&rsquo;s integration with
Windows automation. Our code was untested and our code base was growing over time because our tools proved to be useful and
we were getting more and more feedback. Thus, the code required change more frequently. Without the safety net of tests
for the most basic logic, our feedback loop was slow as it required us to run builds and deploys to adequately cover our
bases.</p>

<p>It was January 1st, 2011. I was a touch hungover from the previous night and was chilling in my apartment in Calgary.
The difficulty in changing our PowerShell code was bothering me enough that I got a bunch of coffee from
<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/caffe-beano-calgary">Cafe Beano</a> and attempted to make an <code>rspec</code> like testing tool for PowerShell. The next day I was able to make a <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester/commit/a1d6a0e01f58375175ed090647ab8245a049f1a6">commit</a>
with actual working code! A few days later I was able to <a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/PowerYaml/commits/master?page=1">add tests</a> to PowerYaml. That&rsquo;s how
<a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester">Pester</a> was born.</p>

<p>In the next couple months I integrated Pester into our project. It was a real superficial integration as we didn&rsquo;t have
too much time to retroactively add a lot of tests. So for me, my consumption of Pester was a few months in early 2011!</p>

<h3>The Early Days (2011 &ndash; 2012)</h3>

<p>Over the course of the year, the tool seemed to be adopted by a few. A <a href="http://mrtn.nrd.io/">friend in Vancouver</a> apparently had begun using it
in one of his projects. He&rsquo;s also the first <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester/commits/master?author=mrtns">contributor</a> to the project! It wasn&rsquo;t until the next year
that <a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder">Rob Reynolds (aka ferventcoder)</a> used Pester in the <a href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> project. That was my
first hint that there&rsquo;s potential in this project.</p>

<p>In 2012 there wasn&rsquo;t much going on until <a href="https://twitter.com/mwrockx">Matt Wrock</a> added mocking support and contributed a whole lot of fixes.
It was then that Pester got a new core maintainer. It was very cool to meet him during my <a href="http://scottmuc.com/blog/categories/career-break/">career break</a>
in Seattle and give him a proper thank you for the work that&rsquo;s done. I believe he also wrote the <a href="http://www.mattwrock.com/post/2012/11/15/Unit-Testing-Powershell-and-Hello-Pester.aspx">earliest post</a>
on Pester. I then noticed a comprehensive post on the <a href="http://blogs.endjin.com/?s=pester">endjin.com</a> blog website.</p>

<p>Seeing other people use Pester was a massively ego boosting thing. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m one of those people in the software
community that does feed off of this kind of thing. For some reason it made me feel validated as a professional in the
software community. Despite the pleasure I got from Pester being associated with me, I decided to move Pester from my
personal github user to a Pester organization. I&rsquo;m really happy I did that, because it made it feel more like a
community project than a personal one. A <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pester">google group</a> was eventually created too as to not clutter
Github with conversations in the issue tracker.</p>

<p>Later on I would find out that it&rsquo;s been used in several <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> projects! These use cases weren&rsquo;t
even initiated by me. Someone wanted to test their PowerShell code, found Pester, and started using it. They would find
out I also worked for ThoughtWorks and would ping me on our internal chat and ask me questions.</p>

<h3>The Year of Change (2013)</h3>

<p>While I was living in India I had several months with some extra time that I used to update Pester. Throughout the year
I spent quite a bit of time maintaining the project. There definitely was a motive for this activity. I knew that
projects that have activity in the codebase are usually favoured by other devs. I still haven&rsquo;t used Pester on a project
since early 2011! There&rsquo;s no functionality that I could possibly need out of Pester but I carved out time to take care
of a few niggling design flaws and close some issues. This resulted in a <a href="http://scottmuc.com/powershell-pester-2-and-1-dot-2-released/">major release</a> which is pretty
much the last time I really did anything to the code. It was great to see another <a href="http://johanleino.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/pester-unit-testing-for-powershell/">quality blog post</a> by
Johan Leino appear on the Web.</p>

<h3>The Year of Transition (2014)</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LogicalDiagram/status/461638955725631488"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/pester-mention.png"></a>
2014 marked a large surge in Pester interest. During the PowerShell Summit it was rumoured that the creator of
PowerShell, <a href="http://www.jsnover.com/blog/">Jeffrey Snover</a>, mentioned Pester in one of his talks! Heck, I was even <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/2014/03/23/episode-262-powerscripting-podcast-scott-muc-on-testing-with-pester/">interviewed</a> for the
PowerScripting Podcast!</p>

<p>Another contributor by the name of <a href="https://twitter.com/nohwnd">Jakub Jareš</a> was very active and soon became a core member of the Pester team. During
my travels on my <a href="http://scottmuc.com/blog/categories/career-break/">career break</a> I got to meet up with him in Prague! He also wrote a
<a href="http://www.powershellmagazine.com/author/jjakub/">couple</a> great articles too.</p>

<p>Now it looks like there&rsquo;s another one joining in too. Welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/MSH_Dave">Dave</a> to the Pester team!</p>

<p>Looking at the logs of the Beta branch, it&rsquo;s wonderful to see my commit percentage diminishing. I&rsquo;ve now only committed
30% of the code base!</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>Though not a big project, I can say I learned a lot maintaining this open source project. There&rsquo;s something very
different than working with a colocated team and random contributors around the world. Colocated teams develop unwritten
rules (a culture) and there&rsquo;s less debate over small issues. I didn&rsquo;t realize how much brace alignment, trailing
whitespace, tab stops, and other petty things would annoy me. What&rsquo;s harder is that I didn&rsquo;t want to complain about it
to the community afraid that I would come across as an OCD control freak. My biggest mistake with Pester was thinking
too much on how it reflected upon me, and not what is good for the community. If I had lived and breathed Windows
projects over the last few years, I think that would have been different. I&rsquo;m happy that Pester has a few excellent
maintainers now and that I&rsquo;ve participated in an open source project from first commit to stepping away.</p>

<p>Another lesson was that empowering would be contributors was an investment well worth doing. It&rsquo;s hard to say, but I
feel that doing this is what&rsquo;s enabled me to lessen my involvement over time.</p>

<p>This talk also resonated with me a bit (the last 4-5 minutes):</p>

<h3>Stepping Down</h3>

<p>The adventure of watching a project grow and have a life on its own has been a wonderful experience. Looking at the
project history and correspondance it&rsquo;s pretty easy to see that I&rsquo;m not nearly as active. That&rsquo;s really thanks to Jakub
and Dave doing nearly all the maintenance.</p>

<p>That being said, I&rsquo;m &ldquo;officially&rdquo; stepping down and retiring from Pester. This will be done by unsubcribing from any
e-mail notifications (the google group, and the github project).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://pesterbdd.com/images/Pester.png">
I would like to shout a big thank you to everyone who made this project so wonderful. Especially to <a href="https://twitter.com/manojlds">Manoj
Mahalingam</a> who did some great work in the early days and really helped me get this project off the ground.
Another shout out to <a href="http://vant.ca/">Stefan Vant</a> for the excellent logo!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>July 22nd &ndash; July 29th</em></p>

<h3>Prague</h3>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/prague.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/prague.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<p>Next portion of the trip is to Eastern Europe! I had a nice simple itinerary to Prague: <strong>Heidelberg &ndash;> Munich &ndash;> Prague</strong>.
Unfortunately something was going on with the brakes on the train and I missed my train in Munich so it
turned into: <strong>Heidelberg &ndash;> Munich &ndash;> Neurberg &ndash;> Cheb &ndash;> Prague</strong>. By now I&rsquo;m a seasoned itinerary refactorer so this
didn&rsquo;t phase me. These little <em>adjustments of the universe</em> can sometimes end up with interesting things happening. At
the Plzen stop, a woman sat across from me in the couchette. She started speaking to me in Czech and my response was the
standard Canadian response: I&rsquo;m sorry?</p>

<br />


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo; or &ldquo;sowry&rdquo; in the short form is Canadian for: I apologize that I don&rsquo;t speak your language and I&rsquo;m embarassed to
ask you to repeat yourself in English because I&rsquo;ve never had to deal with speaking and understanding multiple languages. Of course
I&rsquo;m also making the assumption that you can speak English because a world without English is just unfathomable. Again,
I&rsquo;m sorry</p></blockquote>

<p>Then in English she said I looked Czech and was just inquiring about the train. Turns out
she spoke excellent English, lives in San Diego and was just in the country to visit her family. Eventually we
started chit chatting and the conversation about my trip became the focus of interest. I had fun demoing her the <a href="http://scottmuc.com/twinery/independent-accord.html">cargo ship tour</a>
and got some usability feedback as a result. Next thing I knew we were in Prague. Even with my limited
social ability to pick up on body language, I think she was flirting with me! In my usual fashion I dropped the ball. We
parted ways with a handshake and me wishing her a pleasant visit with her family.</p>

<p>After hitting my head against a wall for what seemed like a decade, I continued on to a rendezvous point in the
train station where I was to meet up with <a href="https://twitter.com/nohwnd">Jakub Jareš</a>. He&rsquo;s a core contributor to <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester">Pester</a>,
who in the last 6 months, has taken pretty much all the maintenance burden off of my shoulders. He offered to take me out for beers and I obviously
couldn&rsquo;t resist an offer like that. It was the rainiest day of the summer and he guided me to the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2094840">airbnb</a>
where I was to stay for the next couple days. Then we proceeded to a <a href="http://www.pivovarskyklub.com/">bar</a> (and got soaked in the process). We enjoyed many beers,
discussed much about software development, and my ineptness with the woman on the train was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>Sandeman operates in Prague too so I did a couple tours:</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/prague-castle.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/prague-castle.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newpraguetours.com/daily-tours/new-prague-free-tour.html">Free Tour</a>: I can&rsquo;t really talk about this tour without talking about the guide. <a href="http://www.newpraguetours.com/our-guides/pavel.html">Pavel</a>
was quite the character. He had an entertaining dry wit and personalized the tour with stories of his own family. I
was blown away when he said is grandmother has lived in the same flat her whole life and has lived in 9 different
countries as a result. It was a good reminder on the craziness humans have to deal with all the time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newpraguetours.com/daily-tours/prague-castle-tour.html">Castle Tour</a>: Fortunately, Pavel was the guide for this tour too! He sort of stumbled over a
little late and asked the group if we could deviate from the standard tour itinerary and visit a
<a href="http://europeupclose.com/article/st-norberts-brewery-in-prague/">monastery</a> where some award winning beer is brewed. No one was opposed and I got to have a fantastic
beer at the beginning of the tour. The castle was very different than other castles I&rsquo;ve seen. The distictive
feature was the cathedral but the surrounding buildings were much different. At the end of the tour, I really
enjoyed walking through the <a href="http://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/guidepost-for-visitors/gardens-of-the-prague-castle.shtml#a5">garden around the ramparts</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I really enjoyed Prague. You really need to avoid the square as much as possible. Once out of the tourist area,
everything is quite afforable and less hectic. Even though my stay was short, I felt that I got the most out of it. I
would like to go back and explore further and do some hacking with Jakub though.</p>

<h3>Arriving in Budapest</h3>

<p>My stay was short in Prague because I had to get to Budapest for the last of my Grand Prix adventure. Fortunately it was
a direct train! The <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1767274">airbnb</a> was close to the station and was able to take the metro there. I was really happy with the
location, and the host was exceptional in responding to my queries. One interesting thing about taking the train around
Europe is that you start to see patterns in the train stations from different countries. There was quite a difference
between the stations in Czech Republic and Slovakia compared to Germany and Hungary. Now I want to create an archive of
train stations so I can do more comparing and contrasting.</p>

<h3>Hungarian Grand Prix</h3>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/budapest-bags.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/budapest-bags.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<p>Getting to the race track was a fairly painless experience in Budapest. The transit workers were also extremely helpful
and knowledgable about the logistics of the race. The track was located in a beautiful area just outside Budapest. I
spent the Friday walking around the track (in 35C weather). The track area was super clean and I think that&rsquo;s owed to
the fact that bright blue garbage bags were never more than 20ft away from you. Overall, I would say this Grand Prix had
the most pleasant logistics experience. More importantly though, this was an <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/28/race-recap-2014-hungarian-grand-prix-a-thrilling-wet-mess/">incredible race</a>! A cloud burst occured
around 60 minutes before the race began. All the drivers had to change their strategies and start with wet tyres. Then
an accident occured a few laps in that caused some pit lane confusion resulting in the leaders being in the middle of
the pack. Nearly every lap had battles going on from all positions. I think this ranks up there as one of the best races
of the year (Bahrain was pretty close). I&rsquo;m sort of sad that my stream of F1 races is over, but also happy because now
the rest of my time is entirely unscheduled. Who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll do a quick detour to Belgium and go to the race there
at the end of the month.</p>

<br />


<br />


<h3>Dream Theater in Budapest</h3>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/dream-theater.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/dream-theater.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<p>As a bonus I saw posters stating that <a href="http://www.dreamtheater.net/">Dream Theater</a> is playing nearby! I&rsquo;ve been a fan of them since 1998 and have never
seen them live! Everything looked too perfect: the venue was a beautiful tram ride away, it starts after the majority of
the F1 events are done, it ended at a decent hour so I could be rested for race day, and tickets were still available!
After freshening up after another hot day at the track I walk to the tram and arrive at the venue around an hour before
the show starts. I was in line to grab some food when the woman next to me asks me a question in Hungarian. Here we go
again! I respond with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo;. She switches to English and asks if I was
ahead of her. I had no idea, and it didn&rsquo;t really matter to me so I said she was first. As I get my food, she asks where
I&rsquo;m from. I tell her I&rsquo;m going to find some beer and she offers to show me where I can sample some
proper Hungarian liquor. I follow her lead and she orders me palinka which is a fruit brandy. Fortunately I&rsquo;m well
adapted to plum whiskey from hazy memories of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Eb7a8-LvQ">ThoughtBoarder</a> trips (thanks <a href="http://www.yycapps.com/2012/09/developer-interview-radu-muresan/">Radu</a>), so the shot goes down easy. She says
she needs to bring the food back to her group and I bid farewell and find a spot in the crowd to watch the show. Ten or
fifteen minutes pass and she finds me in the crowd. We continue to chat about music, travel and Hungary. It turns out
that her dad brought her to the concert (coolest dad in the world!), and she asked if it was ok to hang out with me
during the show (you had to ask?!). You would think that I would have learned my lesson from my previous female
encounter&hellip; nope. Though I did do a bit better. I wrote down my website and she asked if she could find me on Facebook
(I wasn&rsquo;t sure if my profile was searchable, but I said yes). The show was fantastic and made better by having her company.
I got a message from her a few days later and we&rsquo;re still corresponding! Clearly something supernatural was going on as
you can tell from this image of the show.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/budapest-view.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/budapest-view.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<p>The weather following the race was not so good. I managed to explore a little bit around the vicinity of where I was
staying, but spent most of the time catching up with Coursera. Sandeman did not have any presence in Budapest so I took
a free tour by another organization. I can&rsquo;t say it was up to the same standard, but it was still informative
nevertheless. It ended near the castle and I enjoyed a relatively rain free walk back to my flat and prepared for my
next destination, Rome.</p>

<h3>Reunions in Glasgow</h3>

<p>Since my train didn&rsquo;t leave until after noon, I decided to go back to Bletchley Park and spend the
morning there. It was so nice to just spend some idle time in the park and not hurry through the
exhibits. Unrushed, I made my way to the train station for a direct train to Glasgow.
Upon arrival at the station I was greeted by Derek and <a href="http://adidav9.blogspot.cz/">Rose</a> who I know from back in the Calgary
days. They&rsquo;ve been super generous and hosting me at their apartment which is close to the train station.
It was fun to look back at the tough project we worked on together and look at the experience with
fondness and nostalgia. Rose was my concert buddy and Derek was probably the only person I know
that likes <a href="http://www.sundance.tv/series/greenporno">Green Porno</a> as much as I do.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/glasgow-necropolis.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/glasgow-necropolis.small.jpg" width="300"></a> During my first
day I wandered around the city center and then went up to the <a href="http://www.glasgownecropolis.org/">Necropolis</a>. It was
a beautiful place and had a view over the city. Had I been more prepared I would have spent more time
there in search of graves of noteworthy people. On my walk back to the apartment I saw an e-mail from
the company that chartered my cargo ship cruise. Apparently BBC&rsquo;s Travel Show was looking for people
to interview! I got in touch with someone from the BBC, and was scheduled for an interview the next
day.</p>

<p>The next day I spent the morning doing laundry, and then walked over to the BBC for the interview (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0232gkn">the clip is online now</a>).
The camera man was a really cool dude named James Allen. He said he enjoyed the interview
because it was a break from more monotonous stuff he was doing earlier in the day (filming people cooking). Of course
I had to talk about my CBC experience with him and he revealed that he&rsquo;s in a band! They are called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIndPO4OqE">Mummy Short Arms</a>, which is so fitting given the pun I posted on Facebook the day before! After the
interview and lots of walking, I met up with a bunch of ThoughtWorkers for dinner. It became very
clear to me that evening that I miss ThoughtWorkers a lot, but ThoughtWorks not as much.</p>

<h3>Edinburgh</h3>

<p>My last day was spent on a day trip to Edinburgh. People have always said that it&rsquo;s a beautiful city and
they are right. It was more beautiful than I expected and spent the day taking a couple tours. A big
thank you to Rose for telling me about <a href="http://www.neweuropetours.eu/">Sandeman</a> tours. I did the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/edinburgh-free-tour.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/edinburgh-free-tour.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newedinburghtours.com/daily-tours/new-edinburgh-free-tour.html">Free Tour</a>: After this first tour, I was hooked on this style. The guides were young and
full of enthusiasm. My picture of a guided tour was of a slow moving parade of old people getting bombarded
with facts and dates. This tour group does a great job of keeping the energy up. One thing I observed was how focused
the audience got when the guide mentioned that something was a feature or inspiration for a movie, myself included.
It&rsquo;s interesting how pop culture somehow makes things more relevant to your mind.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newedinburghtours.com/daily-tours/castle-tour-edinburgh.html">Castle Tour</a>: Since I liked the free tour so much, I decided to do the castle tour. The guide
was a <a href="http://www.newedinburghtours.com/our-guides/billy.html">charismatic Scotsman</a> and told a story about the castle and Edinburgh in such a way that you could transport
yourself to that era.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was sad to leave Scotland because it&rsquo;s such a friendly place. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s also expensive,
although I guess it&rsquo;s cheaper than London, but that&rsquo;s not saying much.</p>

<h3>Berlin</h3>

<p>I had to wake up at 3:30am to begin my trip to Berlin! The interary was a bit complex: Glasgow &ndash;> London &ndash;> Brussels
&ndash;> Koln &ndash;> Berlin. Here I was going to stay with an ex-ThoughtWorker, <a href="https://twitter.com/pcalcado">Phil Calcado</a>. The interesting
thing about Phil is that I barely know him! I had a couple beers with him
the year before, but he happily hosted me in his awesome flat for several days. I eventually made it to
his place at around 11:00pm (I didn&rsquo;t quite navigate the Berlin metro optimally that evening). There
was a little <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> gathering going on and another ex-ThoughtWorker, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomczarniecki">Tom Czarniecki</a>, was
there too! It seems the world has ThoughtWorks affiliates everywhere.</p>

<p>It appears I timed things well as I got to be in Germany for the world cup final! Myself and Phil went
down to <a href="http://www.pratergarten.de/d/">Prater Biergarten</a>. Tom joined us a bit later. Then for some odd reason, I got interviewed by
a Mexican journalist. I&rsquo;m not making it up, because Phil and Tom will vouch for me. The whole city turned
into a party and we stayed out til around 4:00am. I still can&rsquo;t get the Uber Deuchstland song out of my head.</p>

<p>Like in Edinburgh, Sandeman does tours in Berlin. I did these three:</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/potsdam-tour.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/potsdam-tour.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newberlintours.com/daily-tours/free-tour.html">Free Tour</a>: Like in Edinburgh, the guide was passionate and energetic. It was fascinating to
see the Jewish memorial, and place related to the war.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newberlintours.com/daily-tours/potsdam-city-of-emperors.html">Potsdam</a>: I was craving something different and this tour looked to offer that. I got the same
guide as the day before. I didn&rsquo;t know a single thing about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia">Prussian empire</a> before and this tour made me start
reading tons of Wikipedia articles about it. My favourite part of this tour was wandering the gardens created by
emperors, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanssouci_Park">Sanssouci Park</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newberlintours.com/daily-tours/sachsenhausen-memorial.html">Sauchsenhausen</a>: I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect in a tour of a concentration camp. The
guide impressed me by how he approached the subject matter. I&rsquo;m glad I saw the camp, even
though it can&rsquo;t really be described as a pleasant tour. It&rsquo;s a reminder that normal people can do terrible things.</li>
</ul>


<p>Before I left I had one more evening of beers with yet another <a href="https://twitter.com/dtemme">ex-ThoughtWorker</a>, Daniel Temme!</p>

<h3>Heidelberg</h3>

<p>Travel from Berlin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a> was a direct train. I made my way to my <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2337045">airbnb</a>
and got settled for spending some time in this beautiful town. I purposely planned to have a free day before the F1. I wandered throughout
the old town and the castle. My favourite thing about this part of the trip are the picnics I had; the top one being
on a bench in Philospher&rsquo;s Way. The weather was so hot that I didn&rsquo;t really want to stay inside a restaurant, nor a
patio. It was really nice to simply purchase some groceries and wander around looking for a nice spot in the town to
eat.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/heidelberg-bridge.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/heidelberg-bridge.small.jpg" width="335"></a>

<a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/heidelberg-castle.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/heidelberg-castle.small.jpg" width="335"></a></p>

<h3>German Grand Prix</h3>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/hockenheim-podium.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/hockenheim-podium.small.jpg" width="300"></a>
Getting to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockenheim">Hockenheim</a> was pretty straighforward. There&rsquo;s a bus from the train station, or I can take a
train with a single connection in Manheim. The race weekend was super hot with the air temperature around
35C and they said the track temperature was around 55C! I need to learn what exactly track temperature
means, but I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s how hot it is in you&rsquo;re sitting in the sun.</p>

<p>So far this race is where I&rsquo;ve had the best seats. I was amazing to actually see the cars start the race
and watch them go through the first turn. It was scary to see Massa&rsquo;s car flip during the start of the race but
was relieved to see him walk out of the car. The picture here is a first for me; I actually made it to the podium area for
the awards ceremony!</p>

<h3>Shipment Delivered</h3>

<p>Upon arrival in Antwerp I saw my taxi from the deck. I had all my belongings ready and made my way down
to the port. The ship crew was busy with the offloading of containers so I decided it probably wasn’t a good idea
to disturb them to say farewell. It was a long drive to the immigration office, and there I found out that I needed
a passenger manifest to get the stamp of approval. This meant going all the way back to the ship and back. This
added around an extra hour of taxi travel. The chief mate was ready for my return as he had the document in his
hand. After that confusion, I made it to central Antwerp and found a hotel near the train station.</p>

<p>Antwerp is a fairly small city. The port area takes up more space than the actual city. After a quick nap I wandered
around old Antwerp and in the evening found a little pub. I ended up having more drinks than necessary with a couple
that were a lot of fun. The lady has been in the shipping industry and even knew the ship that I came in on!</p>

<h3>In Bruges</h3>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/bruges.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/bruges.small.jpg" width="300"></a> The trip
from Antwerp to Bruges was pretty easy. As was finding the <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/2176619">residence</a> I was going to stay in. The house was
just outside the old town so after getting some travel logistics out of the way I set out to do a walking tour.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges">Bruges</a> is one of the prettiest towns I’ve ever seen. It’s like a snapshot
in time of Belgium several hundred years ago.  In some spots it was insanely crowded, but in other spots it
was quiet and peaceful, which made me stick to those areas. When I got back, I met Lander, the
host of the house. He was very personable and enjoyed conversing with him about my travels.</p>

<p>The next day I did another self guided walking tour. My favourite moment was just relaxing having a couple beers at the
<a href="http://fr.yelp.be/biz/caf%C3%A9-vlissinghe-brugge">oldest tavern</a> in Bruges. After a full day in the town I went back to the house where Lander invited some friends over for
the game. We then headed out to watch the Belgium game in the town square. It was so much fun! I lost the group for a
bit so I gave my round of beers to some random strangers in the crowd. That seemed to make people happy. Next thing I
know it&rsquo;s 5:00am and I&rsquo;m chatting away with a fellow drunk.</p>

<p>These are the beers I had in Belgium:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dekoninck.be/en">De Koninck</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.boon.be/en/our-beers/geuze-boon-old-style">Gueze Boon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rodenbach.be/">Rodenbach</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.trappistwestmalle.be/en/page/dubbel.aspx">Westmalle Trappist Dubbel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.duvel.com/en-us">Duvel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orval.be/en/58/How-Orval-beer-is-made">Orval</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.abbaye-de-leffe.be/the_beer/en_5_varieties_of_beer_article200.html">Leffe Dark</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.halvemaan.be/index.php?id=15&amp;L=2">Brugse Zot</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bestbelgianspecialbeers.be/main_eng.html">Tripel Karmeliet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.halvemaan.be/index.php?id=14&amp;L=2">Straffe Hendrik</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.achouffe.be/en/beers#la-chouffe">La Chouffe</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Of all of these, I would say the <strong>Tripel Karmeliet</strong> and <strong>Orval</strong> were my favourites. There are so many beers to try
that I really want to come back and spend several weeks sampling all the wonderful beers. There&rsquo;s something about
a country where the monks participate in the brewing process. The day before I got to Bruges, the <a href="http://www.halvemaan.be/">De Halve Maan</a>
had a priest come in and bless their new brewing equipment!</p>

<h3>Dieppe Thoughts</h3>

<p>The next leg of my trip is to Dieppe, France. Unfortunately I woke up hungover and slept through my alarm. This meant
I missed my train which had the best connections to Dieppe. Armed with the
<a href="http://www.eurail.com/plan-your-trip/rail-planner-app">Eurail app</a>, I tried to make a new itinerary.
Due to my decisions of last night, I slept through my connection and passed Brussels. Turned out it didn’t really matter
because at the following station I learned it was the first day of holidays in France and all reservation trains were booked.
Using the app, I figured out an itinerary that could get me to Dieppe without reserved seating. One of the trains was delayed
and I just made my only connecting train with only a minute to spare. Last part of the journey was the walk to to where
I <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1157655">stayed</a>. The only issue was that I forgot to cache the map, but at least I had a star showing where it
was and functional gps.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/dieppe.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/dieppe.small.jpg" width="300"></a> My primary motivation
for visiting Dieppe was to see the beaches the Canadian troops attempted to invade in WWII. The
invasion of Dieppe preceded D-Day and was used as an information gathering invasion. Essentially they learned a lot at
the expenses of thousands of lives. I’m not a patriotic person, but I couldn’t help but feel moved by the lives that were lost
there. You can read more at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieppe_Raid">Wikipedia</a> (notice that my picture of the beach
is very close to the image in Wikipedia!</p>

<p>After my walk about, I walked some more! I headed down to where all the restaurants were and had a nice meal and then
proceeded to hang around the beach area to catch the sunset. It was definitely worth it.</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/dieppe-sunset.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/dieppe-sunset.medium.jpg" width="1024"></a></p>

<h3>A Boat Time</h3>

<p>At 3:30am I left the residence and walked to the ferry terminal. Luckily I walked there the day before so I knew how long
it would take, and that I had to be there at 4:30am. I wasn’t initially planning on being there that early so I’m glad I did
my exploratory research. The ferry was pleasant, but spent the majority of the journey falling asleep and hitting my head against the window.</p>

<h3>London Calling</h3>

<p>The ferry arrived in Newhaven on time. I had a nice chat with the immigration officer who supported my goal of seeing
all the Formula 1 races. I got my luggage and took a series of trains to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchin">Hitchin</a> where
I met up with <a href="https://twitter.com/zoodor">Mark</a>, a old ThoughtWorks colleague. It was quite refreshing to see a familiar face!</p>

<p>My next few days were lunch and dinner plans with people I know in London. I got a chance to talk about where my mind
is at regarding my future. It was also nice to see more familiar faces. I really like London, but all the tubing around I was
doing unfortunately left me with a cold before I left.</p>

<h3>Milton Keynes</h3>

<p>This was to be my face for the first F1 on my trip. My <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1433999">hosts</a> picked up from the
train station. They were amazing hosts and were very pleasant to talk to. I had a lot of fun talking shop
with them as they run an <a href="http://evidencetalks.com/en/">IT business</a> in the city centre.
Their <a href="http://mxcl.github.io/">son</a> is also note-worthy as he created <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>!</p>

<p>The city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> was interesting because it was a planned city.
It was easy to get around, there were plenty of trails that made walking around the periphery quite pleasant.</p>

<h3>This Place is the Bombe!</h3>

<p>I planned for a free day before the race so I could visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park">Bletchley Park</a>.
It was such an amazing experience to see where
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> worked and observing a working Colossus, WITCH, and
Bombe machines (in the <a href="http://www.tnmoc.org/">National Museum of Computing</a>)! While visiting the grounds it made
me think about NSA’s involvement in security. If the NSA had a facility that celebrated its ability to crack codes, I don’t think
people would have the same feeling. WWII was great a creating a binary view of activities. Bletchley Park was also
dismantled after the war. I guess things were simpler and less ambiguous then.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the Colossus sounds like! I wish I recorded a lot more audio because I can hear a song wanting to come out.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Race 1 of 3</h3>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/british-gp.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/career-break/british-gp.small.jpg"></a> The commute to the
track was quite reasonable, but Friday was a bit much for me as I was in the worst part of my cold.
Saturday had the most comfortable weather and I spent a lot of time at the track enjoying different vantage points. Race
day was a big spectacle as it was the 50th race at Silverstone. Before the race there was an air display by the Red Arrows.
It was far better than I had expected. Afterwards I went up to me seat and watched a great race. Lots of drama on the first
lap as Raikonnen had an accident. This red flagged the race as they had to repair a barrier on the track. The rest of the
race was rather uneventful, but the battle between Alonso and Vettel (below) was a show of great driver talent. It was
a shame Roseberg had a malfunction because the battle for 1st could have been just as great.</p>

<h3>To Glasgow</h3>

<p>The journey continues to Glasgow, Scotland! The write up for that will have to wait though as this post is long
enough. I was going to write about my learnings over the last few weeks, but will hold that thought for a bit.</p>

    <id>http://scottmuc.com/crossing-the-atlantic-via-container-ship</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://scottmuc.com/leaving-vancouver-and-north-america/">last post</a>, I finished the crossing of the Atlantic ocean via container ship. It was a great
experiene that I&rsquo;ll happily do again. 11 days wasn&rsquo;t enough, and would be happy to spend a month next time around.</p>

<h3>Too Much Twine on my Hands</h3>

<p>A blog post probably wouldn&rsquo;t due the experience justice so I decided to play around with a basic word game engine to
give you a more <a href="http://scottmuc.com/twinery/independent-accord.html">self-directed tour</a>. Hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>Working with <a href="http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> was quite enjoyable and I could see myself using it a lot in many different lines of work. If I was
still consulting, it would become a prominent tool in my tool-belt. My biggest complaint with it is that the
documentation is all online so I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to do anything more sophisticated than what I created.</p>

<h3>Man Over-bored</h3>

<p>Honestly, that header was just for the pun factor. What amazed me about the voyage was how quick it went by. I didn&rsquo;t
think <strong>once</strong> that I wanted it to end and that I was bored. I savoured not being in a rush to do anything. The only structure to my
days revolved around meals which were at: 07:30, 12:30, and 17:30. That set my rythym for the 11 days.</p>

<h3>Crew Man Group</h3>

<p>The ship was run by a crew of 21, all male. The captain was Romanian and the rest of the officers were Croation. The chief
engineer was Ukrainian and the rest were Filipino. Everyone was very nice, but when asked for their name, they simply
asked to be addressed by their position (Third, Chief, etc&hellip;).</p>

<h3>Retrospective</h3>

<p><strong>What Went Well</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scotch &ndash; Sipping 18yo Glenlivet was a wonderful way to be even <em>more</em> relaxed</li>
<li>Jambox &ndash; This dependable gadget has been filling rooms with tunes well for several years now</li>
<li>Offline Wikipedia &ndash; Wow! I cannot believe how much I perused Wikipedia while I was on this trip.</li>
<li>11 days of no expenses &ndash; Being disconnected is a good way to not spend money.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Not So Well</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gym clothes &ndash; There&rsquo;s an exercise room with a stationary bike. I wasn&rsquo;t always allowed on the main deck (to do laps
around the ship) so being able to do 30min of hard cardio would have been good to stave off the belly I grew.</li>
<li>Scotch &ndash; One bottle was definitely not enough.</li>
<li>Offline map &ndash; I would have liked to better explorer the route and plan the rest of my trip better.</li>
<li>Making Twine tour at the last minute &ndash; I wish I had a skeleton of it done much earlier so I could get more details
from the crew.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Action Items</strong>: I&rsquo;ll definitely do this again and I&rsquo;ll be sure to come with a fitness plan. Though that directly opposes the action to
bring more liquor.</p>

<h3>Offline By Default</h3>

<p>Being disconnected from the world for 11 days was a far better experience than I had expected. It&rsquo;s made me realize I
need to create a habit of disconnecting. It brought me back to the era when your computer was offline by default, and
you had to explicitly connect to see what&rsquo;s going on in the rest of the Internet universe. This experience has showed me
that I like that. It may sound backwards to a lot of people, but the computer has always been a tool, not an
entertainment device (gaming being the exception). My phone may eventually be the only always-connected device, but even
then, I turn off all notifications and keep it silent.</p>

<h3>Let the Eurotrip Begin</h3>

<p>After a 140 euro ride through immigration and into Antwerp, I can begin the next phase of my journey!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After another relaxing two weeks in Vancouver (and attending <a href="http://www.sasquatchfestival.com/">Sasquatch</a>), it&rsquo;s time to leave. Here&rsquo;s the
last sunset I watched from the beach. If you can believe it, the weather in Vancouver was 99% rain free!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/kits-sunset.jpg"></p>

<h3>Schools Out for Summer</h3>

<p>During my downtime I&rsquo;ve enrolled in the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/money">Economics of Banking and Money</a> on <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>. I never
thought I would find learning this stuff so much fun! To supplement the course material, I&rsquo;ve been listening to the
following podcasts too:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.econtalk.org/">EconTalk</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/">Planet Money</a></li>
<li><a href="http://freakonomics.com/radio/">Freakanomics Radio</a></li>
</ul>


<p>This is the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a> I&rsquo;ve taken and I really enjoy the format. It could be the fact that I&rsquo;m older and have
already been established in a career for a while that my approach to learning is different. School always seemed to be
about grades to me growing up. With this course, I&rsquo;m more focused on learning and developing an intuition for the
subject.</p>

<p>From this course I&rsquo;ve learned that the banking and money system is a lot more complicated than I thought. I also now
feel that the system itself isn&rsquo;t altogether evil, it&rsquo;s just trying to facilitate trade the best that it can. I&rsquo;m still
not confident in my ability to summarize what I&rsquo;ve learnt so far, but I think I&rsquo;m going to come out of this much more
empowered.</p>

<h3>Ship Happens</h3>

<p>Today I finally start my voyage on a container ship! You can track where I am on this <a href="http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/636091353/vessel:INDEPENDENT_ACCORD">Facebook for ships</a>
website. If you search for the name &ldquo;Independent Accord&rdquo; in your favourite online search website
you&rsquo;ll see there are dozens of websites that have databases of ships. The websites are pretty well done too. I had no
idea this shipping world can be so interesting. I&rsquo;m sure the captain and crew are going to be sick of my questions over
the next 11 days.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested, <a href="http://www.cruisepeople.co.uk/">here&rsquo;s</a> that I booked my travel through. If you&rsquo;re nostalgic for the 90&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ll
enjoy it a lot.</p>

<h3>Map Reduce</h3>

<p>Since I have all this time on my hands, I&rsquo;ve started journalling the places that I&rsquo;m staying (and coffee shops I leech
Internet off of) in this <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=znoHAqfzfPKU.k2lUp8fKHDCg">online map</a>. It&rsquo;s work in progress and will be fleshed out more as I go.</p>

<h3>Back to Life, Back to Reality</h3>

<p>One question I&rsquo;ve been getting asked frequently is &ldquo;when are you coming back to reality?&rdquo;. I find it an odd question.
This is reality. There&rsquo;s nothing to get back to (unless I could travel in time). Sure, I&rsquo;ll be figuring out what to do
work wise. Not sure how that&rsquo;s coming &ldquo;back&rdquo; to reality though. I think we&rsquo;re living in an era where social norms are
shifting all over the place. Hopes and aspirations appear to be more varied than before. One persons normality is
another persons exceptionality. So when I hear this question my interpretation is &ldquo;when are you coming back to the
lifestyle of yours that I consider normal?&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to feel the career break settling in. I&rsquo;ve slowed things down a lot. My favourite thing to do now is leave
my phone behind and go for a wander. Writing blog posts like this is much more fulfilling than a series of micro-blogs
(aka tweets) that lack context, albeit they are more timely.</p>

<p>See you on the other side!</p>

    <id>http://scottmuc.com/testing-powershell-code-that-talks-to-clr-objects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Several months ago someone posted an excellent question on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pester/Y8UzSiNlcSE">Pester Group</a> about a certain problem area
in testing PowerShell with <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester">Pester</a>.  He brings up a relevant example of the difficulties that can occur when writing tests
is done afterwards. It also reveals a missing feature of Pester.</p>

<p>First let me display the code that needed tests:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/e5abe37881628f13cd0a.js?file=Get-FromSFtp.ps1'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>Add-Type -Path (Join-Path -Path $psScriptRoot &quot;Renci.SshNet.dll&quot;)

function Get-FromSFtp {
    $fileList=$null
    try {
        $sftp=New-Object Renci.SshNet.SftpClient(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;,&quot;test&quot;,&quot;test&quot;)
        $sftp.Connect()
        if($sftp.IsConnected) {
            $sftp.ChangeDirectory(&quot;/test&quot;)
            $fileList=$sftp.ListDirectory(&quot;.&quot;)
        }
        return $fileList
    } catch [Exception] {
        Write-Host $_.Exception.ToString()
    } finally {
        if(($sftp -ne $null) -and ($sftp.IsConnected)) {
            $sftp.Disconnect()
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Here are a couple reasons why this code is difficult to test:</p>

<ul>
<li>Line 4 returns a CLR object that actually does SFTP</li>
<li>Many parameters are hard coded</li>
</ul>


<h3>Start With Integration</h3>

<p>I started this exercise with the intention of not changing a single character of the code submitted. Here&rsquo;s the story of
how the changes took place (I had a git repo of this, but the files got corrupted). First thing to do was to make the
existing code pass a test as is. In order to do that, I needed an integration environment for it to talk to. So I used
<a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to spin up a local linux box. I manually configured the box such that the credentials in the code
work. Here&rsquo;s the Vagrantfile</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/e5abe37881628f13cd0a.js?file=Vagrantfile'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# Vagrantfile API/syntax version. Don&#39;t touch unless you know what you&#39;re doing!
VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = &quot;2&quot;

Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
  config.vm.box = &quot;precise64&quot;
  config.vm.box_url = &quot;http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box&quot;
  config.vm.network &quot;forwarded_port&quot;, guest: 22, host: 22
end
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>and here&rsquo;s the passing test. I&rsquo;m happy with it because I could change the code or the environment and cause the test to
fail, thus giving me confidence that the test is good enough to tell if me I broke anything.</p>

<p>Happy that I have a feedback loop going now, I begin to start testing the code in isolation. I start by writing the
contexts and specifications:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I was stumped for a bit because I realized Pester didn&rsquo;t have the power necessary to do this easily. It didn&rsquo;t mean it
couldn&rsquo;t be tested though. The Mocking functionality came to the rescue as I was able to mock <code>New-Object</code> and decouple
my tests from the <code>Renci.SshNet</code> library. The hard part was hand-rolling the mock object to be used in the tests.</p>

<p>One by one, I made each spec pass. The beginning of each <code>Context</code> was the setup, and each <code>It</code> asserted something from
after that setup and action had been taken. The nice thing that resulted was I could break a specific piece of the
production code, and the specific test would tell me that it&rsquo;s broken at that place (eg: change the directory the
production code goes to).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the complete test file for the code:</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say this is the best test code out there. I think testing PowerShell is in a different place than testing C# or
other OO languages. It seems like the best you can do is test the function logic and test the composition of it all in
an integrated way. The first refactoring change I would likely do to this function is make the connection a parameter.
That way I wouldn&rsquo;t need to mock <code>New-Object</code>, but passing a mock object is still an issue. Perhaps Pester needs a mock
object builder of some kind, though writing mocks by hand wasn&rsquo;t too difficult either. It&rsquo;s something I would expect a
testing framework to be able to do for me though.</p>

    <link href="http://scottmuc.com/two-weeks-living-off-the-clock/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-23T04:44:14+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://scottmuc.com/two-weeks-living-off-the-clock</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the last two weeks I&rsquo;ve been house sitting for a friend in the beautiful area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsilano">Kitsalano</a> in Vancouver. The
goal for the two weeks was to figure out the rest of my travel plans and to meet up with a lot of my friends and
acquaintances that I haven&rsquo;t seen for a while.</p>

<h3>According to Plan?</h3>

<p>The two weeks went by quickly. I mainly organized myself around other people&rsquo;s clocks. This meant meeting people for
lunch or after work the majority of the time. Since I had gaps in time between meet ups, I spent a lot of time walking
everywhere (and sometimes biking). Experiencing many modes of transportation ends up being an influence on me later on.
It was refreshing to not be the dictator of my time, albeit my intentions did dictate who to meet. So by a transitive
relationship, I was still directing my time?</p>

<h3>Natural Time Management</h3>

<p>As an experiment I decided to not turn my morning alarm clock on. I&rsquo;ve always thought of myself as a morning person and
wanted to see if that held true. What ended up happening was that I rolled out of bed around 8:30pm every morning
regardless of when I went to bed (range: 11:00pm &ndash; 1:00am). I&rsquo;m curious about whether or not work pressure (or pressure
in general) has been the cause of my normal much earlier natural wake up time.</p>

<p>Another normal time structure that I thought my body adhered to strictly was when to eat. I started to eat when I was hungry
and found that some days I only ate 1 meal, or my lunch ended up happening at 4pm. There wasn&rsquo;t any natural rhythm to my
eating times.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to start following nature&rsquo;s conventions rather than socially, and I guess structurally imposed ones.</p>

<h3>Career Ideas</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice when part of my &ldquo;mission&rdquo; with this career break moves forward in some dimension. During my many walks along
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawall_(Vancouver)">seawall</a> I&rsquo;ve listened to many episodes of <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/">EconTalk</a>. One in particular got me a little bit
inspired. The episode was about <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/05/charles_marohn.html">Strong Towns</a>, and revealed that I have a lot of interest in urban
development. Shortly after that, I had dinner with a colleague, and conversation with his girlfriend got me inspired
too. It turns out she works for <a href="http://www.translink.ca/">TransLink</a> and she mentioned there&rsquo;s work available for someone with my
skills. What fascinated me was my initial feeling of joy to chat with someone regarding this topic.</p>

<p>Did I mention that I&rsquo;m slowing getting addicted to <a href="http://www.positech.co.uk/democracy3/">Democracy 3</a>?</p>

<h3>Speaking of Transport</h3>

<p>Being mobile via foot, bike, bus, train, and car share has reinforced my thoughts on urban planning. Another part of my
&ldquo;mission&rdquo; is to figure out where to live. Being mobile, while having a low impact, is an opinion that has been further
strengthened while being here. The bicycle is such a wonderful piece of engineering that has changed, relatively, little
over the years. It&rsquo;s an efficient form of transport and it&rsquo;s fun. I can&rsquo;t imagine living anywhere where I wouldn&rsquo;t feel
comfortable riding a bike much of the time.</p>

<h3>Discovering the Source of My Anxiety</h3>

<p>In my <a href="http://scottmuc.com/reflections-of-being-unemployed-and-homeless-for-1-month/">previous post</a> I alluded to a sense of anxiousness that I was feeling. It dawned on me that I was spending a lot of
time coordinating what was going to be a hurried and expensive road trip across the continent. Eventually I realized
that I didn&rsquo;t have to do that trip. I&rsquo;m already going to be doing plenty of travel in the coming months. It also
occurred to me that I spent a good amount of my &ldquo;relaxing&rdquo; time trying to make this trip work. So I&rsquo;ve canceled the
road trip and am going to spend an extra two weeks in Vancouver!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the list of reasons that convinced that this was the right decision:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not providing ample time to truly enjoy the trip</li>
<li>Not being able to spend a proper amount of time visiting each and every person</li>
<li>Going to be more expensive than the cargo ship cruise!</li>
<li>Goes against the principles of this career break which is to take things slowly and this road trip would be a dash to Wilmington, NC</li>
<li>Lessons learned from the SF road trip (I should have slowed it down)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not doing any of the tech related practice I&rsquo;ve wanted to do</li>
</ul>


<p>Not sure if the software analogy fits, but it felt like removing scope from an unfinished project.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Responding to feedback is important. On my road trip to San Francisco I learned that I&rsquo;m not going slow enough during my
time off. During the last two weeks in Vancouver I learned that it&rsquo;s nice to stand still and I wasn&rsquo;t doing too much of
that. The speed of the journey and the complexity in coordinating amongst many people and locations was resulting in an
energy level overhead that was creating anxiety (and how can someone who&rsquo;s not working possibly feel anxious about
anything). Responding to this feedback by canceling the road trip made me feel like a weight was lifted off of my
shoulders.</p>

<p>Along with the negative feedback, I&rsquo;m going to explore the positive feedback my mind felt when pondering ideas around
urban planning and public transport.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I won&rsquo;t get to see a lot of people that I wanted to, but I realized the quality of the interactions is more
important than the quantity of the interactions. This touches on my principle of doing things slowly during this break.
No better way to go slow than to stand still. Queue the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMSFqXGZ5TQ">Rush</a>!</p>

    <link href="http://scottmuc.com/reflections-of-being-unemployed-and-homeless-for-1-month/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-13T07:43:53+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://scottmuc.com/reflections-of-being-unemployed-and-homeless-for-1-month</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For some context, you may want to read my <a href="http://scottmuc.com/leaving-a-dream-job-and-going-on-an-adventure/">previous post</a> about quitting my job.</p>

<p>I am homeless and unemployed in probably the most priveleged meaning of the terms. Both states of being are choices I&rsquo;ve
explicitly made. From what I&rsquo;ve read, I&rsquo;m not really on a sabbatical, but I&rsquo;m on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_break">Career Break</a>, except the homeless
aspect of it is not as conventional.</p>

<p>So here are the reflections:</p>

<h3>Where Am I Sleeping Tonight</h3>

<p>On September 1st 2012 I gave up my awesome apartment in Calgary as I prepared for an assignment in India (without
really knowing where I was going after that). I changed my mailing address to my brothers place and really didn&rsquo;t feel
much had changed. I had already been travelling weekly for my work assignments since April 2011, and I picked up my life
and departed <a href="http://scottmuc.com/blog/a-new-beginning-or-goodbye-20-s-hello-30-s/">Vancouver to Calgary</a> in January 2010.</p>

<p>In the last month I&rsquo;ve spent 13 nights in different beds. One of those nights was part of a 30 hour trip from
Johannesburg to Vancouver, and another night was one where I lost my dignity in Vegas (ask me to show you the scar one
day). I&rsquo;ve learned there&rsquo;s a lot of overhead in figuring out where you&rsquo;re going to sleep (and I have it easy compared to
those who aren&rsquo;t homeless by choice).</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s hit me those most is the disappearance of the sense of belonging. For 8 months I &ldquo;lived&rdquo; in a Residence Inn in
Bellevue, Washington and it was as much of a home as anywhere. I belonged there, had my routine haunts, and knew where I
was going to be for weeks on end. Nowadays I&rsquo;m either imposing on friends and family, or spending too much for a
hotel&hellip; ok, and using home sharing websites which is like a hybrid of the two.</p>

<p>So I guess this break has been successful in teaching me something already. I need to find a place to live. I do like
the traveling lifestyle, but only when I have a home base.</p>

<h3>Talk Talk Talk</h3>

<p>For some reason, this first month break started off strong with lots of conversations with people in the tech industry.
Maybe I was seeking the familiar so these conversations fit in my comfort zone. I&rsquo;ve probably spoken to over 10 or so
companies and am journaling my pursuits as I go. I&rsquo;ve added a constraint on my life that I won&rsquo;t work for 6 months so
it&rsquo;s hard to not jump on what seem to be great opportunities.</p>

<h3>No Startup For Me</h3>

<p>As a technologist, I&rsquo;m passionate about open standards and infrastructure that makes the Internet work. The last thing I
would want as a startup is for my company name to be a verb (eg: Uber, Tweet). Technology like: SMTP, HTTP, HTML, DNS
aren&rsquo;t corporate brand names. I like to live in abstractions, and as a business owner, I think that&rsquo;s probably the worst
characteristic I could probably have in order to be successful.</p>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve challenged myself to minimize the brands names I speak unless it&rsquo;s trully an endorsement for the brand.
Here are some of the translations I&rsquo;m attempting to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tweet &ndash;> microblog</li>
<li>Uber &ndash;> rideshare</li>
<li>Nexus 4 &ndash;> phone</li>
<li>Coke &ndash;> cola</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.marriott.com/">Marriott</a>, on the other hand, is a brand I&rsquo;m happy to publicly endorse.</p>

<p>So yeah&hellip; given that one aspect of success for a startup is something I&rsquo;m not advocating, I think it&rsquo;ll be hard for me
to be part of a startup. Though, I think this really depends on the state of the startup.</p>

<h3>I&rsquo;m Super Lucky</h3>

<p>Part of what has made this break possible is the amazing network of friends and aquaintances I&rsquo;ve made over the years. There
are couches available to me all over the world and that&rsquo;s something I feel super blessed about. I really have to thank
<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/join">ThoughtWorks</a> for enabling me to meet people from everywhere and make these connections.</p>

<h3>A Hint of Concern</h3>

<p>You would think after 1 month of not working I would feel stress free. For some reason there&rsquo;s still a hanging anxiety.
Part of it is probably my first point about finding a home. The other is that I feel there&rsquo;s something bigger that I
should be doing. Being in Vancouver for the last little while has sparked a stream of nostalgia and reflections on a
simpler and a more naive past.</p>

<h3>Familiar is Good</h3>

<p>This probably isn&rsquo;t a surprise to anyone that knows me, but I&rsquo;m a fan of the familiar. When I drove down to Seattle, I
visited <a href="http://www.oobatooba.com/">Ooba Tooba</a> and <a href="http://bathtubginseattle.com/">Bathtub Gin</a>. In San Francisco I went to the <a href="http://www.beresford.com/beresford/restaurant.htm">White Horse Tavern</a>. Anytime I go back to a place I
haven&rsquo;t been to in a while, I favour hitting the familiar places rather than trying something new. This is clearly part
of who I am and find it something I can&rsquo;t negotiate.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I have no idea how to summarize anything right now. The focus is on data ingress and going to delegate the analysis to a
later time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On January 4th 2010 I joined <a href="http://scottmuc.com/blog/a-new-beginning-or-goodbye-20-s-hello-30-s/">ThoughtWorks</a> and it has been an amazing journey. I&rsquo;ve seen more systems,
worked with more people, and seen more countries than the entire 30 years that preceded that date. I still can&rsquo;t believe
how lucky I&rsquo;ve been to have such a wonderful opportunity. That&rsquo;s why it took me a long time to decide to leave it, and
go on a bit of an adventure.</p>

<h2>Why Leave Such a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>For some reason I&rsquo;ve had every job I&rsquo;ve had for 4 years since I was 12 years old, so I&rsquo;m just keeping to my routine! To
be honest though, there were a few things that instigated this change.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Consulting Fatigue</strong> &ndash; It&rsquo;s hard work always coming in as an outsider and trying to convince people to change their
ways. You never know if what you suggest is correct, and there&rsquo;s always so much context to process. One thing that I&rsquo;ve gotten
out of this though is becoming much more of a critical thinker. I&rsquo;ve learned to hold off on knee-jerk reactions and to
actively listen to the problem at hand. This has been something I apply on a day-to-day basis.</li>
<li><strong>Product Complacency</strong> &ndash; Though, I&rsquo;ve worked on some interesting projects (the latest being very cool), I can&rsquo;t shake
the satisfaction I got from working at <a href="http://music.cbc.ca/radio3/">CBC Radio 3</a> where I got to essentially build the product I wanted to
build on my own anyways. This may have been mitigated but the following reason adds to this one.</li>
<li><strong>Miss Small Teams</strong> &ndash; For some reason people thought I was great at working on large programs of work. While I thought
the challenges were interesting, I&rsquo;m more a small business person at heart. Some may be surprised by this because I&rsquo;ve
been on small teams, but they were in these large programs of work. I&rsquo;ve learned that I&rsquo;m more of a system thinker than I
thought and I find myself getting lost in the system thinking and see myself as this tiny insignificant cog just
wanting to make some impactful change.</li>
</ul>


<p>Though I&rsquo;m listing things related to ThoughtWorks, a lot of my weariness is more from IT in general. It could be an age
thing, but I&rsquo;ve been around long enough to see a lot of terrible things going on in this industry. No one seems to care
about security, and the innovation that is making billions in the stock market are consumer products that mean almost
nothing to me. It&rsquo;s hard to be optimistic after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> revealed the NSA privacy issues.</p>

<p>In the last few years I&rsquo;ve managed to save some money, and given that I&rsquo;m still relatively young and healthy, I thought
now is the time to take a break before I get too cynical.</p>

<h2>What am I Going to do?</h2>

<p>The plan right now is pretty loose, but I have made a rough 6 month itinerary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Head back to North America. This will involve crashing at my brother&rsquo;s places and spend some time with family
and friends.</li>
<li>Do some roadtrips in Canada and the USA.</li>
<li>Taking a cargo ship across the Atlantic.</li>
<li>July is the month of Formula 1! I have tickets for the British GP and the German GP.</li>
<li>Visit Eastern Europe.</li>
<li>Hang out in India for a couple months.</li>
</ul>


<p>Along with the travels, I will be taking some mental journeys</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to study economics and capitalism. If we&rsquo;re in this prison of a system, I want to be an educated prisoner.</li>
<li>Get back to the basics of software development and attempt to unlearn all this &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo; cruft I&rsquo;ve picked up.
Hoping to to this by learning a few new languages, doing code katas daily and releasing tiny side projects.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a stretch, but I would like to do some athletic training (mainly running).</li>
</ul>


<p>Like most things, I&rsquo;m probably thinking about it too much, but in this case it&rsquo;s the planning that&rsquo;s been valuable and
not the plan itself.</p>

<h2>Sounds Awesome, but That Cannot Last Forever</h2>

<p>During this time I&rsquo;m attempting to figure out future career ideas. At the end I&rsquo;ll
figure out a place to live and what on my list of interesting domains to pursue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Formula 1</li>
<li>Health care</li>
<li>Beer / Cocktails</li>
<li>Golf</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Public Transportation</li>
<li>Music Distribution</li>
<li>Billiards</li>
<li>Space Exploration</li>
<li>City Planning</li>
<li>Software Delivery</li>
</ul>


<p>Heck, I haven&rsquo;t ruled out re-applying to ThoughtWorks.</p>

<h2>ThoughtWorks Made Me Do This</h2>

<p>The irony is that that ThoughtWorks has opened up my mind in such a way that it&rsquo;s empowered me to make this decision.
The ingress of information, concerns, cultures, opinions and experience is a storm brewing in my head trying it&rsquo;s best to
synthesize itself the best it can. If you&rsquo;re thinking about applying at ThoughtWorks, please ping me. It&rsquo;s an awesome
place to work, and full of great people. During this sabbitcal I plan on visiting as many ThoughtWorkers as I can!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading this post a year from now.</p>

<p>TL;DR &ndash; Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KpPBnEtRj4">this</a> video</p>

<p>Since I first learned the term devops 4 years ago I&rsquo;ve gone through many leaps in understanding. As a software
developer, I find delivering frequently highly motivating. Devops is a set of principles and practices that aim to
ensure delivery goes as smooth as possible. I found this post, <a href="http://blog.devopsguys.com/2014/02/25/a-scientific-basis-for-devops-success/">A Scientific Basis For Devops Success</a>,
to be a great introduction to why devops is important.</p>

<h2>People</h2>

<p>This list isn&rsquo;t comprehensive, but you can&rsquo;t go wrong by reading what these people have to say:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jedi.be/">Patrick Debois</a> &ndash; coined the term devops</li>
<li><a href="http://www.noahsussman.com/">Noah Sussman</a> &ndash; provides excellent insights around QA</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/">John Allspaw</a> &ndash; has many excellent posts on the culture of devops</li>
<li><a href="http://itrevolution.com/">Gene Kim</a> &ndash; co-author of The Phoenix Project</li>
<li><a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/">Jez Humble</a> &ndash; co-author of Continuous Delivery</li>
</ul>


<h2>Devops is not a Role</h2>

<p>It took me a while to realize that devops is not a role played on a team and that it&rsquo;s got more in commong with Agile in
the fact that it&rsquo;s a collection of principles rather than straight up proceesses.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.getchef.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/">CAMS</a> &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/botchagalupe/">John Willis</a>&lsquo; posts a list of principles</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2013/06/04/devops-the-title-match/">Lusis&#8217; rant</a> &ndash; an excellent rant about the absurditity of devops being a role</li>
</ul>


<h2>Must Watch Videos</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KpPBnEtRj4">The Devops Transformation</a> &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/benr/">Ben Rockwood</a> does a most
enlightening talk on the subject.</li>

    <link href="http://scottmuc.com/my-developer-resolutions-for-2014/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-02T10:45:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://scottmuc.com/my-developer-resolutions-for-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was tempted to not write this post. My motivations are changing a bit and growing strong technically isn&rsquo;t one of
my top priorities nowadays.</p>

<h2>Reflections on <a href="http://scottmuc.com/my-developer-resolutions-for-2013/">2013</a></h2>

<p>Last year was very interesting for me. It&rsquo;s the first time I didn&rsquo;t really have a home. I&rsquo;ve split my time between
India, United States, and South Africa, (ok, I was in Toronto for a few weeks too). During that time I&rsquo;ve reflected a
lot (probably too much). My work was split between training new software developers and developing tools to deploy
the largest and most complex distributed system I&rsquo;ve ever worked on.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s look back at 2013 and see how I did with my resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read 7 Languages in 7 Weeks &ndash; This was a massive fail. I never even got past chapter 1!</li>
<li>More Presentations &ndash; I would give myself a passing grade here. I&rsquo;ve started doing more internal presentations, but
I&rsquo;m sure that there&rsquo;s expectation for me to do more. The problem here is that I really don&rsquo;t enjoy delivering
presentations, but I do struggle when I believe I have interesting things to say and they&rsquo;re stuck in my head. I
definitely need an outlet and will have to figure this out going forward.</li>
<li>Expand my Ops Toolbelt &ndash; This one was definitely a success. I&rsquo;ve picked up Puppet, Ansible and MCollective. Also, I
feel that I&rsquo;ve grown quite adept at Continuous Delivery pipelines and Vagrantizing development environments.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Development Goals for 2014:</h2>

<p>2014 is going to be a different year for me. I don&rsquo;t really care about goals as much, but want to build better habits. I&rsquo;ve reached
many of my goals only to regress behaviour after the goals have been achieved. I&rsquo;ve realized that many of my technical
goals were due more to my ego and fear of looking dumb in front of colleagues and clients. I&rsquo;ve realized that I actually
have a pretty good personal brand, and that people respect my abilities. I&rsquo;ve proven myself over and over again, and
it&rsquo;s time for me to believe it myself.</p>

<h3>Increase Signal to Noise Ratio</h3>

<p>Social media tax is too high for me right now. It&rsquo;s time to start culling the amount of inputs I have. At least I&rsquo;ve
deleted my LinkedIn account. I&rsquo;m going to have a daily unfriend/unfollow 1 person, until I feel things are a bit more
manageable. One small victory in 2013 was deleting my LinkedIn account.</p>

<p>Improving my e-mail habits are up there as well. Things like not checking my e-mail before work is a habit that I plan
on picking up. I also need to write less e-mails. E-mails beget more e-mail.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Friends at end of 2013</strong> == 480</li>
<li><strong>Following on Twitter at of 2013</strong> == 627</li>
</ul>


<h3>Learn Docker</h3>

<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll sneak in a technical goal. I want to simply understand what the hype is around <a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>. I tend to be very slow
to catch onto trends. There&rsquo;s enough hype around Docker that I think I should at least understand what I&rsquo;m missing if I
do miss that boat.</p>

<h3>Do Meaningful Work</h3>

<p>4 years ago I left <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/">CBC</a> for <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. I don&rsquo;t regret the decision at all, but I now understand what it&rsquo;s like to do
meaningful work. Working on <a href="http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2009/12/Today-on-Lanarama-Techie-Tuesday-A-Fond-Farewell-to-Scott-Muc">Radio 3</a> was fulfilling work, and I&rsquo;m still proud of what was created, and have strong
connections with the people I worked with there.</p>

<p>The tough part about the consulting business is that you can potentially work for money hungry
organisations. I personally don&rsquo;t want to help retail vendors sell more shirts, or banks earn more interest.
ThoughtWorks does do a lot of meaningful work, and I&rsquo;m going to do something I find more fulfilling. Another
stint in India doing ThoughtWorks University would be something that would satisfying this need.</p>

<p>Being a competent developer, I think I owe it to society to do what I can for a greater good. So I&rsquo;m looking at
contributing to <a href="http://www.mailpile.is/">MailPile</a> as a first step. The open government space is something I would like to explore as
well.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I think 2013 was a bit of a downer because of what&rsquo;s been revealed by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/1">Edward Snowden</a>. The numerous large scale
<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/12/31/3108661/10-biggest-privacy-security-breaches-rocked-2013/">theft of e-mail addresses and passwords</a> have also lowered confidence in IT as a whole. Let&rsquo;s not talk about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/20/4859316/healthcare-gov-woes">Obama Care</a>.
It&rsquo;s frustating to see the industry that I love so much do so much harm, and become so untrustworthy.
2014 is going to shape to be an interesting year as a result of these events.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-03T19:31:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://scottmuc.com/valuable-links-vim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>First Off &ndash; Introducing Valuable Links</h2>

<p>Today I&rsquo;ve decided to start something new. I tend to send my friends and colleagues
links about all sorts of things. Usually when they are pertinent to a problem they are
having, or to supplement a conversation I&rsquo;ve had with them. My usual process to reproduce
these links ends up being a search in: <a href="https://twitter.com/scottmuc/" title="My Twitter Feed">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://getpocket.com/users/scottmuc" title="My Pocket Feed">Pocket</a>, History, and my Bookmarks.</p>

<p>Also, when I share my links I tend to write a few sentences about them. It adds a personal
touch and a bit of context, so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m exploring this channel for displaying them.
As opposed to using a bookmarking website.</p>

<h2>Valuable Links for Vim</h2>

<p>I would say I&rsquo;m a moderate <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> user. I have a simple <code>.vimrc</code> with few plugins. Learning
to be competent at <code>vim</code> has made my computing experience so much better. Here are a few
websites that have helped me out:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.danielmiessler.com/study/vim/" title="Daniel Miessler's Vim Primer">Vim Primer</a> &ndash; I can&rsquo;t think of a more thorough primer. Even after knowing
vim for a while I learned a lot from this article. Not only that, it helped reinforce
the things I knew already to better explain them.</li>
<li><a href="http://statico.github.io/vim.html" title="Vim After 11 Years">Vim After 11 Years</a> &ndash; A good story on someone&rsquo;s journey learning
vim for the last 11 years.</li>
<li><a href="http://vimgolf.com/" title="Vim Golf">Vim Golf</a> &ndash; Try and do the editing exercises in the minimum number of keystrokes.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/" title="Destroy All Software">Destroy All Software</a> &ndash; Watching <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt" title="Gary's Twitter Feed">Gary Bernhardt</a> is a great
way to learn vim. His excellent screencasts have 3 episodes focused on Vim:
<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/file-navigation-in-vim" title="File Navigation in Vim">File Navigation in Vim</a>, <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/some-vim-tips" title="Some Vim Tips">Some Vim Tips</a>, and
<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/the-vimrc" title="The vimrc">The vimrc</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>My Own Tips</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disable the arrow keys. They just encourage bad habits. For me, I had to use the
<code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>l</code>, and <code>l</code> out of necessity. I travel a lot, and writing code on an
airplane is difficult if you have to move your hand to the arrow keys. The key is
not to do this too early otherwise you&rsquo;ll be frustrated like <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">Yehuda Katz</a>.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use a premade vim configuration. Things like <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus" title="Janus">Janus</a> make it easy
for vim to behave more like <a href="http://macromates.com/" title="TextMate">TextMate</a> or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" title="Sublime Editor">Sublime</a> (both great
editors), but if that&rsquo;s what you want, why not just use them? Instead, strive to
keep your <code>.vimrc</code> your own and rely on plugins to get the benefits of the excellent
work that&rsquo;s been done by other people. <a href="http://blog.clifreeder.com/blog/2012/07/08/leaving-janus-for-vim/" title="Leaving Janus">Clif Reeder</a> articulates when
to leave Janus quite well.</li>
<li>Keep it simple! The more you stray from default, the more dependant you are on
your own configuration. Use plugins in order to extend functionality. If you can&rsquo;t
explain every line of your own <code>.vimrc</code> then either figure it out, or remove it.</li>
<li>As you grow more comfortable, start using vim everywhere. If you use <strong>gmail</strong>, turn
on the keyboard shortcuts (some of them are vim like). If you&rsquo;re using Chrome,
install <a href="http://vimium.github.io/">Vimium</a>. It allows you to navigate the browser
as if it&rsquo;s vim. There&rsquo;s even
<a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">VsVim</a>
for Visual Studio users!</li>
</ul>


<p>Admittedly, I still have a lot to learn. I&rsquo;m by no means an expert.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> &ndash; I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;learn it the hard way&rdquo; type of person. So that may explain
my thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed the first of what could be many &ldquo;valuable links&rdquo; posts.</p>

    <link href="http://scottmuc.com/the-most-over-engineered-thing-I-have-made/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-25T08:13:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://scottmuc.com/the-most-over-engineered-thing-I-have-made</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I overheard some interns boasting about their complicated shell setup. They felt pretty good about
using tmux, zsh, and aliasing the heck out of everything. One of them had to re-map copy and paste because they messed
that up, but they felt awesome when they figured out a clever work around.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there at some point. It&rsquo;s something that you grow out of over time. At least I hope so. Here&rsquo;s a story of
the most complicated thing I&rsquo;ve made and I&rsquo;ll start with a network diagram of my basement suite circa 2003:</p>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/complicated-network.png" title="Network Diagram"><img class="center" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/complicated-network.png" width="600"></a></p>

<h2>My Contribution to Over-Engineering</h2>

<p>Hmm, after looking at that network diagram again, I&rsquo;m now thinking about how complicated I&rsquo;ve made a lot of things!
Anyways, the most complicated thing I&rsquo;ve made was a music playing setup for my home. Doesn&rsquo;t sound like it should
be complicated, right?</p>

<p>Here are some of the requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rebooting my laptop doesn&rsquo;t stop the music. I was quad booting (that&rsquo;s another story) and would switch frequently</li>
<li>Control can be from any computer (I did some NAT translation so I could control it from outside the house too)</li>
<li>The machine playing the music had to be quiet (PCs those days were much louder)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Architecture</h3>

<blockquote><p>The result was an mp3 playing system that required 5 computers in order to work.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/complicated-rack.jpg" title="Server Rack"><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/complicated-rack.jpg" width="300"></a> First there was the <strong>file server</strong> that contained
all my music. It would expose files to the network via Nfs and Samba. I was pretty meticulous when it came to
organizing my files. Every artist had a directory, and every album was a sub-directory. In case you&rsquo;re wondering,
I organized artist names as <em>Last Name, First Name</em>. All the mp3s were created by ripping my personal CD collection.</p>

<p>Second was the <strong>music player</strong> box. This was an underclocked machine with no hard drive. This way I was able to run it
without any fans except for the power supply. It used PXE boot load the operating system and would Nfs mount it&rsquo;s filesystem.
The only thing running on it was <a href="http://www.musicpd.org/" title="Music Player Daemon Website">music player daemon</a> which played mp3s that were also Nfs mounted.</p>

<p>So since I required PXE boot, I setup a <strong>network config</strong> server. It was my local DNS, DHCP, and TFTP host. I
configured DHCP to respond to the MAC address of the music player box and provide it a TFTP location to fetch its kernel.
I had a DNS zone setup that handled internal .muc-central.com records (eg: jukebox.muc-central.com).</p>

<p>Those 3 servers were sufficient to have a working music playing system, but it didn&rsquo;t have a user interface. This
required the addition the <strong>web server</strong> which ran Apache and PHP to host <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:PhpMp" title="PHP Music Player">PhpMp</a> that connected to the music
player boxes <code>mpd</code> service.</p>

<p>Now with a UI, you can start playing songs, and update a playlist from any machine in the house. The 5th machine is the
<strong>client</strong>, which was my laptop at the time. This was before the era of smart phones, but I imagine with some tweaks, a
mobile web browser would have worked just fine too.</p>

<h2>The Result</h2>

<p><a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/complicated-livingroom.jpg" title="Living Room"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/complicated-livingroom.jpg" width="515"></a>
<a href="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/complicated-ui.jpg" title="Screenshot"><img class="left" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/complicated-ui.jpg" width="515"></a></p>

<p><span style="color: #eaeaea;">hack to break the floats</span></p>

<p>The machine that plays music is in a closet near the entrance into my apartment. Then I setup some shelves to
put my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-ACS48-Computer-Speakers/product-reviews/B00000JBJF" title="ACS48 Reviews">Altec Langsing ACS48</a> speakers on top of. The volume on the speakers was set to max so the volume could be
controlled through the software.</p>

<p>The web interface wasn&rsquo;t fancy but I still prefer it to many of the applications I&rsquo;ve used recently. It&rsquo;s a basic PHP
app called <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:PhpMp" title="PHP Music Player">PhpMp</a>. What I liked about it the most was the playlist was easy to modify. My friends would browse
the music collection and click a link to add a song to the playlist. The only picture I can find is an old desktop
screenshot where you can see the playlist in the bottom left of the screen.</p>

<h2>Lesson Learned</h2>

<p>Although I would never set something up like that again, I&rsquo;m glad I did it. It was an excellent learning experience and
it actually was one of the best digital music setups I had. It also was the gateway to me starting to write technical
<a href="http://muc-central.com/articles/index.php?file=FreeBSD%20Jukebox" title="My First Online Article">articles</a> online 10 years ago! While listening to the interns, it came to me that this is simply a right
of passage. I don&rsquo;t think I would be where I am today if I did the simplest thing to solve all my problems. One thing it
did make me think about is that I probably should contrive complex solutions as a way to practice my understanding
of of complex systems.</p>

<p>Things I learned by doing this:</p>

<ul>
<li>PXE booting</li>
<li>Diskless computing</li>
<li>TFTP</li>
<li>Non trivial DHCP</li>
</ul>

<p>No, this is not an April Fools joke. This was something that was actually implemented.</p>

<p>After ThoughtWorks University was over we had a backlog of work items that needed to be done before we all went back to
billable work. I wanted to put up a Kanban board with 3 columns (TODO, WIP, DONE) to track the work we needed to do. A
question popped into my head; is 3 columns the minimum number necessary?</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mfait">Michael Fait</a>, a colleague of mine, challenged this notion saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>First, we can get rid of DONE. Just rip up the card.Second, we can remove WIP by putting stickies with names on them on the cards being worked on.</p></blockquote>


<p>Then we wanted to consider priority, so we had the most important things float to the top. Less important items could
not float up until the top ones were removed. &ldquo;Like a fish tank!&rdquo;, one of us exclaimed! The metaphor went crazy from that
point forward. Somehow we introduced sharks and they live near the surface eating all the meat (tasks) that float to
the top. Pairing is represented by sharks eating the same piece of meat. If a shark is out, then they hang out on the beach.</p>

<h3>Make Your Own Shark Tank</h3>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfydvDUncbY">Draw sharks</a> representing each person on the team.</li>
<li>Put <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-Tack">blu tack</a> on the back of the sharks.</li>
<li>Draw the surface of the water, this is where work will get done.</li>
<li>Put stickies in the tank representing work that needs to get done.</li>
<li>As the sharks eat the stickies, let the next level of stickies float on up.</li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://scottmuc.com/going-against-the-flow/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-10T23:41:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://scottmuc.com/going-against-the-flow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Developers like to talk about being in a state of
<a href="http://psygrammer.com/2011/02/10/the-flow-programming-in-ecstasy/">flow</a>. This is when time just seems to fly
by and you&rsquo;re writing more code in a few hours than you do in several days when you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;flowing&rdquo;. While I think
flowing can be postive, it often can do more harm than good if going on for <strong>too long</strong>.</p>

<p>In the past I would complain that the environment around me kept me from the <strong>flow</strong>. I would look forward to the quiet
times in the office when I could zone out for hours and complete some wild and crazy code I was working on. Many times
I would return the next day and realize that I could have done it simpler, or there were many other aspects of the
problem that I didn&rsquo;t take into consideration. One of the biggest complaints about flow is that it takes a long time to
get into that state. How can we minimize this time, and keep these flows shorter?</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://scottmuc.com/images/blog/flow.png">What I found myself needing were breaks. Brief moments to reflect on the past bit of effort and reflect on what work was
done and where it&rsquo;s heading. Many times this has resulted in an &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment and see that my path is not going towards a
solution that is best for the project. It&rsquo;s also a good time to check your assumptions. You may be flowing towards a
dead-end because of something a little bit of planning could have prevented. Like the diagram to the right suggests,
flow can result in effort that&rsquo;s far from the solution, whereas the small bursts follow a &ldquo;truer&rdquo; path. After the flow
session is it easy to get back on track? Sometimes it&rsquo;s best to simply eliminate all you&rsquo;ve worked on and start from
scratch.</p>

<p>This leads me to <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/spike_solutions.html">spiking</a>. Getting into a flow can be useful
when performing a spike. It can reduce the spike time, but is it really possible to flow when working on something you
don&rsquo;t have any clue about?</p>

<p>When programming solo I try my best to always practice the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro technique</a>.
There have been so many times that the break (and I try to be disciplined about stopping when the timer goes off, even
when I&rsquo;m in the middle of something) introduces new ways of tackling the problem.</p>

<p>When pairing I experience similar gains with breaks. I never considered this technique when pairing, because I always thought that the
practice already mitigated the risks I mentioned earlier. That may be true, but thanks to <a href="http://johnpdaigle.com/">Paul Daigle</a>, I
found that it was just as effective when pairing. It&rsquo;s even better because you have
someone to reflect upon the pairing session with. A quick time away from the code is a good time to recall what problem
you&rsquo;re actually trying to solve and whether or not the direction you&rsquo;re going is actually going to lead you there.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re leading a technical team and you see everyone glued to their monitors and typing franctically, you might think
that they are &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; and working at a heightened level of productivity. Think again, they could possibly be racing towards
the wrong direction. A team that&rsquo;s moving around, going for walks, taking 5 to do a
<a href="http://www.tabatatimer.com/">tabata</a> to me is a sign of a more switched on team.</p>

    <link href="http://scottmuc.com/powershell-pester-2-and-1-dot-2-released/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-02T15:34:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://scottmuc.com/powershell-pester-2-and-1-dot-2-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a whirlwind of activity on the <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester">Pester</a> codebase I&rsquo;m happy to announce the latest release of Pester. Versions 1.2 and 2 are identical feature wise except for one subtle difference that I&rsquo;ll get into soon.</p>

<h2>New Expectation and Matcher Syntax</h2>

<p>In prior versions of Pester, we have the dot notation expectation and matcher syntax</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$some_string</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">should</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">be</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;some value&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This required some <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester/blob/bf3afbf330808cfee8a26665a77c9388ae432286/ObjectAdaptations/types.ps1xml">clever and downright nasty hacks</a> to the PowerShell runtime. This created a <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester/issues/19">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester/issues/27">issues</a> for some users and I wanted to get that fixed. It turned out the extension on Object was the root issue so I investigated a pipeline based expectation syntax. Here is the result:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$deployDir</span>                <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">Should</span> <span class="n">Be</span> <span class="s2">&quot;C:\inetpub\wwwroot\myApp&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;iis:\Sites\myApp&quot;</span>        <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">Should</span> <span class="n">Exist</span> <span class="c"># this works with any PowerShell provider</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;C:\test\rush_albums.txt&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">Should</span> <span class="n">Contain</span> <span class="n">2112</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span>                        <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">Should</span> <span class="n">Be</span> <span class="n">NullOrEmpty</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">throw</span> <span class="p">}</span>                 <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">Should</span> <span class="n">Throw</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Negative statements work too:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;C:\temp\deployment_scratch_space&quot;</span>  <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">Should</span> <span class="n">Not</span> <span class="n">Exist</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;C:\test\rush_albums.txt&quot;</span>           <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">Should</span> <span class="n">Not</span> <span class="n">Contain</span> <span class="n">5150</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">3</span>                               <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">Should</span> <span class="n">Not</span> <span class="n">Be</span> <span class="n">NullOrEmpty</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">Deploy-Website</span> <span class="s2">&quot;superawesome&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>   <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">Should</span> <span class="n">Not</span> <span class="n">Throw</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Extending the syntax is simply a matter of adding domain specific expectations, that follow the Pester function naming
conventions, to your test suite:</p>

<p>Pretty cool, eh? I feel that this can lessen the potential bloat of expectations in Pester and allow people to write
test suites that fit their infrastructure domain model. The expectations are also very <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester/blob/master/Functions/Assertions/Be.Tests.ps1">easy to test</a> in isolation. The core matchers are pretty light, but they should be easy to modify now that matchers have test coverage unlike the previous syntax.</p>

<p>Adding your own matcher requires you to add 3 convention following functions. One that is the matcher, and 2 that return
failure messages for postive and negative expectations. The biggest problem I see with this method is that if the
convention ever changes, I&rsquo;ll have to be very cautious and make it backwards compatible.</p>

<h2>Mocks!</h2>

<p>This was released earlier but I didn&rsquo;t really announce anything. Thanks to <a href="http://www.mattwrock.com/">Matt Wrock</a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/mwrockx">twitter</a>) Pester has the ability to mock cmdlets. I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying this out on my next project.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="n">Mock</span> <span class="nb">Get-Location</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;you are home, sir.&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">Get-Location</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">Should</span> <span class="n">Be</span> <span class="s2">&quot;you are home, sir.&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Description Tagging</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/rismoney">Rich Siegel</a>, Pester can now run blocks that fit a certain tag.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="n">Describe</span> <span class="n">-Tag</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Acceptance&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Website deployment flow&quot;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">It</span> <span class="s2">&quot;...&quot;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">...</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># and run it like this:</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">Invoke-Pester</span> <span class="n">-Tag</span> <span class="n">Acceptance</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Xml Reporting</h2>

<p>Another contributor is <a href="https://github.com/mbergmann">Max Bergmann</a> who added NUnit style xml reporting to Pester runs.
We are even using it in Pester&rsquo;s own <a href="http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project261&amp;tab=projectOverview">CI build</a>.
There&rsquo;s some XML validation bugs that are still being sorted out.</p>

<h2>Why 1.2.x and 2.0.x?</h2>

<p>The motivation for this release is to fix the issues people have add where a <code>should</code> property is added to every Object.
I&rsquo;m not sure how exactly it was breaking things, but it was messy anyways, and I wanted to get rid of it.</p>

<p>In version <code>1.2.x</code>, you can disable the old assertions by running Pester with the <code>-DisableLegacyExpectations</code>. This will
mean that your test suite has to only use the new pipeline style expectations.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="c"># version 1.2.x has this switch</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">Invoke-Pester</span> <span class="n">-DisableLegacyExpectations</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For version <code>2.0.x</code> we disable the old style assertions and you need to explicitly enable them using the
<code>-EnableLegacyExpectations</code> switch. In the next significant release we&rsquo;re going to remove the dot style assertions
completely from the codebase.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="c"># version 2.0.x has this switch</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">Invoke-Pester</span> <span class="n">-EnableLegacyExpectations</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So if you&rsquo;re upgrading Pester, then you should probably move to <code>1.2.x</code> first. If you can run your tests with the
<code>-DisableLegacyAssertions</code> flag set, then you should be fine to move to <code>2.0.x</code>. If you&rsquo;re starting from scratch, then
definitely use <code>2.0.x</code>.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Left To Do?</h2>

<p>Lots and lots of documenting. The <code>Get-Help</code> pages need to be updated and I want to get pesterbdd.com up as soon as
possible. I think version 2 should be a fairly stable version of Pester.</p>

    <link href="http://scottmuc.com/setting-up-overtone/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-27T21:11:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://scottmuc.com/setting-up-overtone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every now and then I like to sit in a coffee shop on a Sunday and focus on writing some code. This weekend I had the pleasure of spending this geeky time with a colleague, <a href="http://literateprogrammer.blogspot.in/">Chris Ford</a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/ctford">twitter</a>).</p>

<p>Chris has gotten me interested into an open source toolkit for creating sounds and making music called <a href="https://github.com/overtone/overtone">Overtone</a>. Here&rsquo;s a talk about demonstrates functional composition using clojure through music and overtone.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mfsnlbd-4xQ " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>That talk made me want to play with overtone. Here&rsquo;s the diary of my workstation setup.</p>

<h2>Leiningen</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://leiningen.org/img/leiningen.jpg"> Thinking I know what I&rsquo;m doing I say &ldquo;So, Overtone is in Clojure, right? So I&rsquo;ll first install that.&rdquo;. To which he replied &ldquo;No, you need to install <a href="http://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>.&rdquo;. What?! I want to install clojure, why do I need this oddly named tool? Already my world has been turned upside down.</p>

<p>Leiningen is a package manager for Clojure. I can&rsquo;t say I understand completely what it&rsquo;s doing, but when I did a <code>sudo port install leiningen</code> I saw Maven was being installed. Chris calmed me down and said that <code>lein</code> hides the pain so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the install works. I run <code>lein new mucmusic</code> and a simple project structure is setup for me. I updated the <code>project.clj</code> to refer to the 1.4.0 version of Clojure.</p>

<p>I then run <code>lein repl</code> and see the package manager at work. It downloads Clojure for me and I&rsquo;m in a repl. I try the most basic thing I know <code>(+ 1 1)</code> and it works! I can only imagine what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes. I find it interesting that a package management tool is responsible for obtaining the language you&rsquo;re going to develop in. It makes a whole lot of sense actually. It&rsquo;s sort of like <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>, but not quite.</p>

<h2>Clojure</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="http://clojure.org/space/showimage/clojure-icon.gif"> Since I&rsquo;m still coming to grips on writing code in Clojure I can&rsquo;t comment on the language, but what I really like so far is how accessible the documentation is. Simply evaluating <code>(doc +)</code> will print the documentation for &lsquo;+&rsquo; function  and <code>(source +)</code> prints out the source code. The REPL made it very easy to get started.</p>

<p>One thing that tripped me up was using a namespace I had defined. I learned the the &lsquo; character is used to indicate the following text is a symbol and not to be evaluated. Also, the first project I created had an underscore in it. In order to use that namespace I had to use a hyphen when using it.</p>

<h2>Overtone</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://overtone.github.com/media/logo.png"> Happy that I can write and evaluate Clojure code it was time to setup Overtone. This part was really nice. All I did was update the <code>project.clj</code> file and added the overtone dependency. The next time I ran <code>lein repl</code> it downloaded overtone and set everything up for me.</p>

<p>In the repl I loaded overtone via <code>(use 'overtone.live)</code> and here&rsquo;s the output:</p>

<pre><code>reply.eval-modes.nrepl=&gt; (use 'overtone.live)
--&gt; Loading Overtone...
--&gt; Booting internal SuperCollider server...
--&gt; Connecting to internal SuperCollider server...
--&gt; Connection established

 \____/ |___/\___/_/   \__/\____/_/ /_/\___/

    Collaborative Programmable Music. v0.8

Hello ThoughtWorks, just take a moment to pause and focus your creative powers...
</code></pre>

<p>Woah! Booting internal SuperCollider server? Is Clojure so powerful that I can run my own atom smasher?
Turns out the answer is unknown on that, but what <code>overtone.live</code> does is smartly start up
<a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/">SuperCollider</a> which is &ldquo;an environment and programming language
for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition&rdquo;. Ahh! So overtone needs this to actually
create audio.</p>

<p>I continue to follow the <a href="https://github.com/overtone/overtone">README</a> and make my first sound.</p>

<pre><code>(demo (sin-osc))
</code></pre>

<p>This code rewards me with the beautiful sound that is a sine wave. Curious as to what <code>demo</code> and <code>sin-osc</code>
do I load up the docs in the repl.</p>

<pre><code>overtone.live/demo
([&amp; body])
Macro
  Listen to an anonymous synth definition for a fixed period of time.
  Useful for experimentation.  If the root node is not an out ugen, then
  it will add one automatically.  You can specify a timeout in seconds
  as the first argument otherwise it defaults to *demo-time* ms. See
  #'run for a version of demo that does not add an out ugen.

  (demo (sin-osc 440))      ;=&gt; plays a sine wave for *demo-time* ms
  (demo 0.5 (sin-osc 440))  ;=&gt; plays a sine wave for half a second
nil
user=&gt; (doc sin-osc)
-------------------------
overtone.live/sin-osc
([freq phase])

  Sine table lookup oscillator 

  [freq 440.0, phase 0.0]

  freq  - Frequency in Hertz 
  phase - Phase offset or modulator in radians 

  Outputs a sine wave with values oscillating between -1 and 1 similar to 
  osc except that the table has already been fixed as a sine table of 8192 
  entries.

  Sine waves are often used for creating sub-basses or are mixed with 
  other waveforms to add extra body or bottom end to a sound. They contain 
  no harmonics and consist entirely of the fundamental frequency. This 
  means that they're not suitable for subtractive synthesis i.e. 
  passing through filters such as a hpf or lpf. However, they are useful 
  for additive synthesis i.e. adding multiple sine waves together at 
  different frequencies, amplitudes and phase to create new timbres.

<p>No wonder people love programming in clojure! This idea of the documentation living in the
code is wonderful. I&rsquo;m generally used to googling for a function name, but this makes that step
unnecessary.</p>

<h2>VimClojure</h2>

<p>Chris, like myself, also uses <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. So first thing I wanted to do is get some syntax highlighting. Chris points me to <a href="https://github.com/daveray/vimclojure-easy">vimclojure-easy</a>, but I didn&rsquo;t want to replace my vim configuration. I already maintain my vim in a tidy and versioned way. Looking at the this repo gave me the direction I needed to set this up. I cloned <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/VimClojure">VimClojure</a> into my <code>~/.vim/bundle</code> directory (and removed its .git directory). I launch vim on a clojure file and I have syntax highlighting!</p>

<h2>lein-tarsier and nailgun</h2>

<p>Thinking I was complete I tried some of the vim shortcuts to evaluate some clojure from within vim. Then I realized I&rsquo;m
not quite done (feels like my visit to the <a href="http://indianfrro.gov.in/frro/">FRRO</a>. This is now where the JVM comes in.
Clojure is a JIT compiled language. In order to compile, it needs a JVM. Starting up a JVM all the time is a very
slow and painful process.</p>

<p>Lein-tarsier (tarsier is the type of creature on the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529833.do">O&#8217;Reilly Vim book</a>
is a lein plugin that starts up a VimClojure server. To install this, I just added it to my lein profile. It didn&rsquo;t work
at first, but that was because MacPorts installs version 1.6 of lein. Nailgun was some C code that you have to download a compile and make reference to it in your vimrc. I&rsquo;m sort of lost on how all these components work together.</p>

<p>A quick <code>lein upgrade</code> got me to version 2.0. Then an execution of <code>lein vimclojure</code> and the server is up and running.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>After installing a bunch of oddly named things I was able to play the pieces from Chris&#8217; talk in vim.</p>

<p>There were some details that I left out (and forgot). I don&rsquo;t think I would have gotten this far without help from Chris
and the considerable documentation that&rsquo;s in the README files and wikis. Part of me also thinks that it shouldn&rsquo;t
require this much work. As a side project, I&rsquo;m going to look into pulling all of these steps into a Vagrant
configuration management setup. I think it would be nice to go <code>vagrant up overtone</code> and have a working overtone
development environment.</p>
