Over a year ago [I posted a life update][previous-update], and now it’s time for another! In Nov 2021 I hinted about a
new job I was starting. So let's go back a year and see how that developed.

[previous-update]: /life-work-covid/

## 2022

### Entering ClimatePartner

The job was with [ClimatePartner][climatepartner] and as a team lead role. A team lead in this context was a mix of tech
leadership and people management. Along with that, I was bootstrapping the technical organisation in the Berlin office.
The job began in Jan of 2022.

Several months were spent learning about the organisation, the mission, and what role software had to play. It came
clear early on that going back to a full 40hr work week wasn’t something I want to regress on and thankfully was able to
switch to a 32hr work week a few months in.

The Berlin team wasn’t going to appear from thin air so a lot of my time was spent interviewing candidates. It wasn’t
until June of 2022 that the first new hire of Berlin was coming to the office. New hires would be added to the roster
every single month until the end of the year!

### Permanent Residency

In the meantime, I also managed to get my [German Permanent Residency title][prhomepage]! This was a huge milestone and
has been a goal of mine for a couple years. This was one of the goals connected to working again. As articulated in my
last post, permanent residency wasn’t the only goal of employment, but an aligned benefit.

The feeling of relief and freedom after acquiring this permit is hard to describe. To keep it short, acquiring permanent
residence means I can live in Germany without being employed  which is like reverting back to a tourist visa which has a
limit of 3 months. All of the sudden many possibilities entered my field of view. All of which are obscured by my
current work obligation status.

Again, a huge thank you goes to [Legal Links][legallinks], specifically [Juliane Linke][juliane] and
[Sophie Baumann][sophie], who were a joy to work with and experts in their field. Money well spent.

### Covid Again

As mentioned in my last update, I had the OG Covid and it was horrible. Over a year had passed and I still didn’t have
my taste/smell back 100%. In June of 2022 I caught Covid again. It hit me like a ton of bricks again, but thankfully it
was a shorter stint. I fully lost my taste/smell again too. The odd thing is though; when the taste/smell came back, it
returned much stronger than before I caught Covid the second time!

I did a little travelling in Feb/Mar of 2023 and I noticed that my taste/smell were still improving. Perhaps it was
being in the same place for 3 years that desensitised me. I wouldn’t say I’m back 100% but I’m back sufficiently enough
that I can enjoy a much wider selection of food and drink, so much so that it’s made dining out pleasurable again.

That being said, I do wonder what the long-term impact of having Covid will have going forward.

### Shelly Passing Away

Sadly, Shelly passed away during this time. I knew adopting an old cat would have a shorter time span, but 3 years was
shorter than expected. Not much to say other than it was a very difficult time for me. I’ll get another cat at some
point but not sure when yet.

### Lack of Motivation and A Fork in the Road

At this point (Aug 2022), I was feeling like something wasn’t quite right. My motivation was down, and I couldn’t say
much of my surroundings or people were the cause of it. I felt like I didn’t simply fit in with what I was doing. It
wasn’t quite imposter-syndrome because I felt competent at what I was doing. In the end, I am questioning my current
career direction in software.

I couldn’t have predicted the feeling of empowerment the permanent residency gave me. During a train trip in August (my
first real trip since Mar 2020), I gave a thought to my current life/work trajectory. Some books I read during the trip
are:

* **Wild Problems** ([my review][wildproblems]) by Russ Roberts and **Transformative Experience**
  ([my review][transformativeexp]) by L.A. Paul -- These two books gave me the confidence to make a risky decision and
  a bold choice.
* **Midlife** ([my review][midlife]) by Kieran Setiya -- Helped me understand that many people feel this way at this
  point in their life. It gave me a language to understand my lack of motivation. I recommend that you read my review
  since there's a lot of context there.

Over the course of the trip I felt I had to make a decision on whether or not to leave ClimatePartner or stay. By the
end of the trip, I decided that I needed to leave!

I think my book review of Midlife describes my rationale for my decision. To summarise, I want to take some time to
explore work outside my bailiwick. Though I can’t deny a decreased interest in my current industry.

### Leaving ClimatePartner

The decision to leave was made in August and I gave my notice in September. This meant I would be working until the end
of the year (3 month notice period). Little did I know how much the remaining months would test me.

As each month passed, the vibe and culture in the Berlin office was becoming incredibly rich, fun, and energising. I was
extremely proud of the people that I was a large part in bringing to ClimatePartner Berlin but was feeling guilt and
sadness for leaving them so early. It also tested my rationale to leave. I’m glad it was difficult though because
despite the incredible people and team I was leaving, I still felt in my gut that I was doing the right thing.

During my last days the teams gave me the most amazing farewell I could have imagined. I didn’t want to do much and I
suggested a graveyard walk as a group activity (I learned earlier that many others on the team like strolling in
graveyards too). They turned it into a funeral ceremony for me and even read a eulogy to my departure! They also gave me
this hilarious conversation guide (inspired by the How to Sound Like Boromir meme). Below is a wonderful capture of the
spirit of the office, and I am proud of the framed picture the team gave me as my final gift. Sadly, ClimatePartner laid
off 50% (Feb 2023) of the folks in Berlin so several of the people in the picture are now looking for work).

Like SoundCloud, ClimatePartner was on the shorter side of employment stints I’ve had, but impactful. Building up the
teams in Berlin has been one of the most rewarding things I’ve done in my career. But now it’s time to move on.

## 2023

### Goal Revisiting

To start the year, I thought it would be good to revisit the goals I stated [back in 2021][2021goals]. I’ve had a
dubious history of goal setting on this blog but nevertheless do ok in progressing or course correcting. Here’s the
progress made so far:

* **Permanent Residence** ✔️  -- Complete! Things really fell apart on this in 2021, but happy to have exitted 2022 with this
  special entitlement.
* **Winding Down Work** ✔️  -- Complete! I was working 4 days a week with VMware from Apr 2021. Likewise, I was
  doing the same with ClimatePartner in 2022. Now I’m unemployed and revisiting my relationship with income and work.
* **Cycling Initiative** 🚧 -- This hasn’t gone so well. I was tracking progress in 2021 and was doing some significant
  rides, but this regressed in 2022.
* **Launch Personal Finance Website** 🚧 -- The extra time has worked well in helping me better understand what I want to
  build.

Feels good to have a couple of these significant goals checked off, and decent progress made on the others. I plan on
continuing with the unfinished goals and reflect on goal setting in 2023.

### Starting Career Break #2

So… Now what?

The books I read over August, and the continuous emotional test of my decision over the last few months at
ClimatePartner, gave me something to ponder. I knew I wasn’t getting the same satisfaction from my career as I was
previously. I was on autopilot for a bit, and at some point was at a place where I wasn’t sure I liked doing my job
anymore.

On the train ride back home in August, I asked myself one simple question: “How would you feel if you were at
ClimatePartner 5 years from now?”. My immediate answer to myself was “regret”. I would regret not having the courage to
pursue all the things that don’t exist on my current career path.

So… I am going to explore those things. Along the way, I hope to rediscover the things I intrinsically am motivated to
do. Over the last few months, this has narrowed down to 3 specific topics:

* Personal finance mindset and modelling
* Gaming (development, playing, reviewing, designing)
* Personal IT infrastructure aka SmallOps

I can’t really say specifically what I’ll end up doing, but those are 3 topics that I can effortlessly research,
explore, tinker, share, and educate. My only plan is to see where these interests take me for the next little while.

My last career break was a special time in my life. The context was different; I was younger, didn’t have a fixed
address. This time around, I have a home that I love. My travel ambitions are smaller and nearer. I’m going to travel in
mind and spirit more this time around, and less physically.

I did take 3 weeks to travel by rail and ferry to Brussels, London, Cardiff/Swansea, Liverpool, Dublin. So physical
travel isn’t completely out:

### Updates

I understand that being absent from social media has made it harder for everyone to keep tabs on what I'm up to, so I'm
going to re-evaluate how to broadcast updates in a humane way.
