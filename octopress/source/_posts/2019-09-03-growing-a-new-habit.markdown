Let’s start with what a habit means to me. It’s something that one does nearly unconsciously. Habits are powerful forces
for good and bad. A good way to identify your habits is to ask someone who knows you well. Your actions reveal your
habits, not what you think you do.

Some personal examples:

* Opening up a bag of crisps after having a beer Repaving my machines when it’s a new month (my username is the month that
my machines were paved) Clearing the kitchen counter after finishing a meal 
* I recently read Atomic Habits and it describes a framework for habit creation in an easy to consume way. I’ve been
pretty good at fostering habits (I believe) but this book helped me understand a bit more on why some efforts worked and
others didn’t.
* This post will describe how I’m trying to nurture a new habit.

## Context

For the last couple years I have been working from home. I absolutely love it but there are some behavior changes that I
believe are necessary to maintain a healthy remote work life.

## The Habit

For the most part I’m a morning person. I have no data to confirm this, nor any roommates to interview to validate this
belief. I want to be able to put structure around my remote work day so I don’t fall into the trap of linking my home to
work.

The habit I wanted to build is to venture outside before I look at any computer screen.

Here are the laws, albeit a liberal use of the word, James Clear lists on how to create a good habit:

### 1st Law - Make it Obvious

I have these stickies outside my bathroom. My trigger is the natural biological function of needing to expel some liquid
from my body. When I exit the bathroom I see my progress. 

### 2nd Law - Make it Attractive

I live in a nice neighborhood so it makes walking around always a pleasant activity.

### 3rd Law - Make it Easy

For this I told myself that it’s sufficient to just take the garbage out. I live on the 4th floor without an elevator.
Fifty percent of the time I decide to at least walk a lap around the block. The important part is going outside, not
walking for 60 minutes every morning.

Another intentional activity I do to make it easy is to hold off on listening to a podcast episode until the morning.

Lastly, I make sure some clothes are ready to wear next to my bed.

### 4th Law - Make it Satisfying

The tracking of this makes it satisfying. When August finished and I was green across the board, I was very happy.

## Other Benefits

The motivation of this habit was to not turn into this

<insert Oatmeal cartoon>

All sorts of benefits emerged that I didn’t plan for.

The morning walk was a natural time to clean the cat’s litter box and take it out to the bio bin If I hadn’t had
breakfast first, I can go to the nearby bakery or grocery store to grab fresh product and bread It’s a great time to
take out bottles to the recycling depots It’s enabled me to listen to more podcasts as that’s something that’s reduced
when the commute is gone

## Summary

It’s going to be interesting to see how sticky this habit will remain. One question I have is when should I stop
updating the post its? It’s not really a habit until it doesn’t require tracking, right? That being said, I already have
an unconscious urge to go for a walk in the morning. It might not be as script as requiring it before looking at a
screen, but my mornings would feel odd without a quick stroll first.

This is one example of nurturing a good habit. Let’s see what a follow up would look like by destroying a bad habit!
