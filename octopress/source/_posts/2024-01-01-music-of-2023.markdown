Music has been a big part of my life since at least 1990. It was a great bonding
moment with my oldest brother as we both got into They Might Be Giants - Flood
at the same time (and independently). He got me into going to concerts, and
indie music.

My joy and participation in music has been a constant and I've always enjoyed
sharing my experiences and discoveries. This is my attempt at turning what is
usually an e-mail to a few friends into a blog post.

## The Return of Concerts

[{% img center /images/blog/concerts/tickets-2023.small.jpg 800 %}](/images/blog/concerts/tickets-2023.jpg)

With the pandemic restrictions behind, it was great to see the return of concerts
to Berlin. There are several concerts per day and there were many events I had
to decline. Still, I managed to make it out to the following gigs:

* 24.03.2023 The Handsome Family at [Privatclub][privatclub]

Ghost and Tangerine Dream feel like the highlights to me. Something about these
shows felt really special. Regardless, there wasn't a bad show in this list.
All were enjoyable and many were attended by friends as well (half I went to alone).
It's also interesting to see I didn't go to any venue more than twice.

## Music Discovery

Over time I've found a sustainable way of discovering new music without feeling
too overwhelmed. The [All Songs Considered podcast][allsongs] has been a great source of
music curation that I've followed since 2016. Over the year I add noteworthy
songs to a playlist on YouTube. Over the last few days I've narrowed these picks
down to something that can be listened to in a session. My pick for 2023 have a
nostalgic tone for me. As well as a tilt towards female vocalists.

Here's the playlist. I tried to organise it in a way that makes for an enjoyable
musical journey.

Below is a reference to which episode I learnt about the track. I do this
because the podcasts give great commentary on the background of the artist,
album, and song.

## Summary

This was fun to write and I find the exercise of citing the source of the song
enjoyable. Let me know if you would like me to retroactively do similar posts
going back a few years.

*This post took 3 pomodoros (about the length of the playlist)*
