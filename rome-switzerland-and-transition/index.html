<div class="entry-content"><h3>When in Rome</h3>

<p>When I learned that my uncle and his family would be in Rome I looked at my schedule to see if I could make seeing them
work. It turned out it fit perfectly! The last time I saw them was in London while they were doing their 2013 summer
trip and I was on my Belgian Grand Prix vacation. My aunt and uncle are well versed in the world of business so we had
many evenings discussing what I&rsquo;ve learned from the economics courses and floating ideas of what&rsquo;s next for my life. Of
course I got to catch up with my cousins too. Can&rsquo;t believe how quickly they are growing up (I won&rsquo;t mention that I
remember seeing them in diapers to avoid their embarassment).  They had rented a flat near the Spanish Steps which made
it easy for me to cram in a bunch of sight-seeing in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Touring Rome is pretty easy because all you have to do is step outside. Even on my first walk I stumbled across many
interersting sites. I did a couple free walking tours, but they weren&rsquo;t organized by Sandeman and weren&rsquo;t nearly the
same quality. Still, it was good to have a guided walk to the Colloseum and to the Vatican.</p>

<p>As beautiful as Rome was, I knew my time as a tourist was ending. I was at the point where I didn&rsquo;t want to elbow my
way through tourists anymore. Nor was I as interested as I was before in exploring musuems and historical places.</p>

<h3>Swiss Bliss</h3>

<p>The other part that made Rome convenient was that I could travel to Switzerland to meet up with fellow ex-ThoughtWork
Marc Hofer, who I worked with in India in ThoughtWorks University (TWU). He had a 1L bottle of scotch ready (we numbed our
heads with scotch nearly every evening during TWU). Thankfully he was generous enough to give me a couch for as long as
I needed one. I ended up spending 10 days in beautiful Thun!</p>

<p>I spent most of my days reading and catching up on my blog writing (it&rsquo;s surprising how long these take to write).
Though I did spend a day biking to Interlaken and another day visiting Geneve, Zurich, and Luzern by train.</p>
