		<p>The term &ldquo;devops&rdquo; has only existed for 5 years and the trend is to label your tool as a devops tool in order for it to
gain traction. When I look at the landscape of tools, most look like Ops tools, just relabeled.</p>
<p>The reason this has been on my mind is that myself and <a href="twitter.com/rdsubhas">Subhas</a> released a website called
<a href="http://www.devopsbookmarks.com/">Devops Bookmarks</a> to aggregate all the tools in the landscape. Using a <a href="https://github.com/devopsbookmarks/devopsbookmarks.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Github Pull Request</a>
for contributions results in reviewing a lot of tools and after a short amount of time I found myself second-guessing
the need for such a website. It felt that we were diluting the devops term.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KpPBnEtRj4">this</a> video and read <a href="https://sethvargo.com/the-ten-myths-of-devops/">the 10 myths of DevOps</a> (which also links to
what I now find is the best <a href="https://vimeo.com/101735253">video</a> on devops).</p>
<p>Since I first learned the term devops 4 years ago I&rsquo;ve gone through many leaps in understanding. I really wish I saw
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7-IuYS0iSE">this video (history of devops)</a> before I got involved. As a software developer, I find delivering
frequently highly motivating. Devops is a set of principles and practices that aim to ensure delivery goes as smooth
as possible. I found this post, <a href="http://blog.devopsguys.com/2014/02/25/a-scientific-basis-for-devops-success/">A Scientific Basis For Devops Success</a>, to be a great introduction
to why devops is important.</p>
