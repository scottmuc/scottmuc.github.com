		<p>Why a links post about Git? There are plenty of resources, right? Exactly! There&rsquo;s almost too many resources around Git and you can reach a profiency in Git with just a few.</p>
<p>For fun, check out the results of this search for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/git">git books</a> vs <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/svn">svn books</a>. Hopefully this post will help you to never need to go through that list.</p>
<h2 id="some-opinions">Some Opinions</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to me that <code>git</code> is a tool one can become skilled at. When using <code>svn</code> I never felt that I had to learn advanced things (I did own one of those books listed above though). Perhaps it&rsquo;s more a sign of the times and the number of people in software has grown immensely; which is great!.</p>

		<p>This is embarassing to admit but I have to re-learn Transport Layer Security (TLS) on a continuous basis. This post
is my cheatsheet to remembering all the itty bitty details, which I&rsquo;ll forgot shortly after I do whatever TLS related
task I have on my plate.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s TLS you ask? Take 9 minutes to listen to this fantastic episode on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04vqrwy">Public key cryptography</a>
which will prime (hah!) you up for the rest of the post.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite surprising that I haven&rsquo;t really brought up the topic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasts</a> on my blog considering that
I&rsquo;ve been consuming them for almost 10 years! My methods and taste have changed a lot over the years. I want a place
to point people when asked about what podcasts I listen to, and with a little more context than just a pure list.</p>
<h2 id="software--tools">Software / Tools</h2>
<p>A podcast is such a simple concept (from the technical side) that it allows for a lot of tools and applications to be
created around the idea. Nowadays I pretty much use a single application on my phone. I&rsquo;m generally only concerned with
the mobile experience since I try to listen to podcasts when I&rsquo;m on the move and when I&rsquo;m not focusing on work. Ask me
to listen to a podcast while programming and you&rsquo;ll discover that I won&rsquo;t be able to recall anything from the podcast
(or that I don&rsquo;t do any programming). The application I use is <a href="http://www.shiftyjelly.com/android/pocketcasts">PocketCasts</a>. The homepage is full of
hyperbole and non-truthes (eg: &hellip; deliver the updates instantly&hellip;), but it&rsquo;s an alright application and fits my needs for
now. Most importantly, it allows me to export my subscribed shows as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opml">OPML file</a> which I&rsquo;ve made
<a href="podcasts_opml.xml">available to you</a>.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KpPBnEtRj4">this</a> video and read <a href="https://sethvargo.com/the-ten-myths-of-devops/">the 10 myths of DevOps</a> (which also links to
what I now find is the best <a href="https://vimeo.com/101735253">video</a> on devops).</p>
<p>Since I first learned the term devops 4 years ago I&rsquo;ve gone through many leaps in understanding. I really wish I saw
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7-IuYS0iSE">this video (history of devops)</a> before I got involved. As a software developer, I find delivering
frequently highly motivating. Devops is a set of principles and practices that aim to ensure delivery goes as smooth
as possible. I found this post, <a href="http://blog.devopsguys.com/2014/02/25/a-scientific-basis-for-devops-success/">A Scientific Basis For Devops Success</a>, to be a great introduction
to why devops is important.</p>

		<h2 id="first-off---introducing-valuable-links">First Off - Introducing Valuable Links</h2>
<p>Today I&rsquo;ve decided to start something new. I tend to send my friends and colleagues
links about all sorts of things. Usually when they are pertinent to a problem they are
having, or to supplement a conversation I&rsquo;ve had with them. My usual process to reproduce
these links ends up being a search in: <a href="https://twitter.com/scottmuc/" title="My Twitter Feed">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://getpocket.com/users/scottmuc" title="My Pocket Feed">Pocket</a>, History, and my Bookmarks.</p>
<p>Also, when I share my links I tend to write a few sentences about them. It adds a personal
touch and a bit of context, so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m exploring this channel for displaying them.
As opposed to using a bookmarking website.</p>
