      <description>Why a links post about Git? There are plenty of resources, right? Exactly! There&amp;rsquo;s almost too many resources around Git and you can reach a profiency in Git with just a few.&#xA;For fun, check out the results of this search for git books vs svn books. Hopefully this post will help you to never need to go through that list.&#xA;Some Opinions It&amp;rsquo;s funny to me that git is a tool one can become skilled at.</description>

      <description>This is embarassing to admit but I have to re-learn Transport Layer Security (TLS) on a continuous basis. This post is my cheatsheet to remembering all the itty bitty details, which I&amp;rsquo;ll forgot shortly after I do whatever TLS related task I have on my plate.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s TLS you ask? Take 9 minutes to listen to this fantastic episode on Public key cryptography which will prime (hah!) you up for the rest of the post.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite surprising that I haven&amp;rsquo;t really brought up the topic of podcasts on my blog considering that I&amp;rsquo;ve been consuming them for almost 10 years! My methods and taste have changed a lot over the years. I want a place to point people when asked about what podcasts I listen to, and with a little more context than just a pure list.&#xA;Software / Tools A podcast is such a simple concept (from the technical side) that it allows for a lot of tools and applications to be created around the idea.</description>

      <description>Valuable Links for Devops TL;DR - Watch this video and read the 10 myths of DevOps (which also links to what I now find is the best video on devops).&#xA;Since I first learned the term devops 4 years ago I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through many leaps in understanding.

      <description>First Off - Introducing Valuable Links Today I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start something new. I tend to send my friends and colleagues links about all sorts of things. Usually when they are pertinent to a problem they are having, or to supplement a conversation I&amp;rsquo;ve had with them.
