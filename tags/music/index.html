		Last year&rsquo;s post was fun to write and I like the journalling component of this exercise. Let&rsquo;s see if I can continue and make it a routine.
A Bumper Crop of Concerts 2024 was an exceptional year for great concerts. 27 of them to be precise! This was a year where my appetite for live music was huge. I made efforts to ensure that my life had space for these shows.

		Earlier this year I was chatting with a friend about the band Rush. I said they played a fundamental part of who I am and still have an impact on me today. This prompted them to ask how they could learn more. The most wonderful thing for any Rush fan to hear.
I&rsquo;ll start by describing how I learnt about them. It was through my brothers who are older than me and they still joke about how as a child I would giggle to this guitar part in The Trees.

		Music has been a big part of my life since at least 1990. It was a great bonding moment with my oldest brother as we both got into They Might Be Giants - Flood at the same time (and independently). He got me into going to concerts, and indie music.
My joy and participation in music has been a constant and I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed sharing my experiences and discoveries. This is my attempt at turning what is usually an e-mail to a few friends into a blog post.
