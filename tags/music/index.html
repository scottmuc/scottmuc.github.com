		Earlier this year I was chatting with a friend about the band Rush. I said they played a fundamental part of who I am and still have an impact on me today. This prompted them to ask how they could learn more. The most wonderful thing for any Rush fan to hear.
I&rsquo;ll start by describing how I learnt about them. It was through my brothers who are older than me and they still joke about how as a child I would giggle to this guitar part in The Trees.
