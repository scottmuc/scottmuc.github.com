Hello Internet and welcome to my tiny slice of Internet real-estate. My name is Scott and I grew up in Vancouver,
Canada, but now my current location updates quite frequently. Just assume that I'm somewhere on planet Earth.

This website is a hodge podge of things that have inspired me enough to write about them. It's gone from being quick
technical to now a tiny platform for me to write about life experiences and the like.
