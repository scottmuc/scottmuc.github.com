*September 20th - December 16th*

Believe it or not, it's pretty easy to sum up the 3 months I spent in India. This is primarily because I'm still
traveled out and I've explored India a lot when I lived here for 8 months starting near the end of 2012.

The minute I got off the plane I was greeted with the familiar scent of Bangalore. The city gives me a bizarre sense of
being home. My arrival to India this time around is much different than the paniced call to Calgary at 4am where my
arrange pickup wasn't there. This time I breezed through the crowd to the taxi line and made my way to Indiranagar where
I was to stay in a wonderful [guest house][guest-house] for the next long while.

In my first week I got to attend my 3rd wedding in India. This one was a small catholic ceremony, but still a valid
excuse to wear the Ukrainian shirt my cousins got for me.

It was the end of monsoon season and there was a bit more rain than last time. It was quite refreshing because it kept
the air clean for a little while. There was one evening where the road leading up to my apartment was flooded and had to
wade through knee deep "water".

### Work Life Balance

My goal in India was to finish my job search and just chill out for a little while. But first, I had to find a place
where I could hang out for most of the day to use the Internet. I first tried *FILL IN NAME* which was on Church St,
just a few minutes away from MG Road metro station. It had good Internet and there were other people around that made it
feel nice. The next day I tried Beaglesloft as it was started by an ex-ThoughtWorker. It was a short walk from Trinity
metro station, and it was decent too. A bit too quiet though.

### Findind Nilenso

Neither of the previous two compared to hanging out at the Nilenso office. I found them through a loose 

### Pune

After a few weeks I scheduled a trip to Pune to see some old friends and meet a company for a job interview. I had
Internet issues at the place I was staying at so I had to go to Starbucks nearly everyday for interviews and other
correspondance.

The job interview went really well, but declined to pursue the job any further as it felt like it would be ThoughtWorks
part 2. I used the down time to write a couple blog posts and do a little cooking.

### Beer Tour

Bangalore has a beer scene that's growing strong. In this trip alone I was able to visit 10 brewpubs and that's not
hitting them all!

* [Toit][toit] - Definitely one of my favourites. I think I went there at least once a week. I highly recommend their
  weiss beer.
* [Murphy's][murphys] - Only went their once for lunch. None of their beers really stood out to me. I regret not going
  again because the view is quite nice.
* [Windmills][windmills] - Overall, I think Windmills makes the best beer in Bangalore. It's a bit of a trek because
  it's all the way in Whitefield.
* [Barleyz][barleyz] - The beer isn't that great, but the rooftop terrace is a good reason to go there. All the beers
  tasted too watery.
* [Biere Club][biere-club] - A decent spot with decent beers.
* [Arbor][arbor] - Arbor always shows up as the place to go for the best beer in Bangalore. I do think the beer is ok,
  but it's not even close to Windmills in quality. I also found their beer gave me an allergic reaction. The beer is not
  filtered and I know sometimes that can affect me, but it was more pronounced there.
* [Vapour][vapour] - I ignored this spot for a while due to people around me saying it wasn't very good. While not all
  beers were of consistent quality, the red ale was pretty good and their weiss beer was decent too. It's also a nice
  roof top patio that serves decent food.
* [Big Pitcher][big-pitcher] - A giant establishment. Only checked it out once. There were a couple decent beers, but
  the others tasted really off.
* [Brewsky][brewsky] - Best IPA I've had in India. The dunkel was also really good, but the rest were quite bad.
* [Prost][prost] - I've heard mixed reviews about the beers, but I found them to be pretty good. The Big Ben ale reminds
  me a lot of the English Bay Pale Ale, which is an old favourite of mine. Their stout is quite good too, which is a
  beer that doesn't seem to get much love in other Bangalore pubs.

### Summary

All and all, this trip to India is a very stark contrast compared to my previous visit. I didn't do a whole lot of
traveling. It was really a low-key retreat so that I could do lots of reading, podcast listening, computering, and
reflecting. Sort of makes me wish I wrote about my previous trip because that one was definitely a lot more things going
on, but this trip was exactly what I needed/wanted.
