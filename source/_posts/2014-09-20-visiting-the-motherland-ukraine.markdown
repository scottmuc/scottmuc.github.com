### Ukraine

The next leg of the journey was a long slog from Vienna to [L’viv][lviv]. I took a noon train to Budapest and had to pass
some time there for a little while. From Budapest it was an overnight journey with many frequent stops in the
middle of the night for immigration and customs. If you’ve ever played [Papers, Please][papers-please], it felt like that. Ukraine
isn’t part of the Shengan agreement so you can’t just cross the border without a documents check. Around a few
hours from L’viv the train asks me about my purpose in Ukraine. She then points at my “ringless” ring finger and
smiles. I knew of the Russian/Ukrainian bride thing, but found that that her first guess was for that pretty crazy.
I thought it was a hyped up, but after watching a few [youtube documentaries][ukrainian-brides] about it, I learned
it’s sadly alive and well.

Even with such a long journey the train pretty much arrived on time within a couple minutes. When I exited the train I
immediately could recognize my cousin [Lilia][lilia-twitter]. She ran up to me and gave me a proper family style hug. Looks like I’m
home! We took a bus to her home in the Northern part of the city. I was introduced to her roommate,
[Vitalik][vitalik-twitter]. He and I got along really well. He’s a web designer and looks to have a knack for it!
Lilia had to go back to work so I unpacked
and made myself at home. Later that evening Lilia’s sister, Natalia, arrived by train from [Ternopil][ternopil]. She had a huge
package of food from her parents and we all enjoyed a feast as I did my best to describe myself and the Myц family
history in Canada.

I felt immediately comfortable in L’viv. As Lilia was at work, Vitalek and Natalia guided me around the city. Here
are some of the noteworthy places we checked out:

* [Lviv brewery][lviv-brewery]
* [High Castle][high-castle]
* [Dim Legend][dim-legend]
* [Gas lamp][gas-lamp]
* [Rynok Square][rynok-square]
* [Lviv chocolate][lviv-chocolate]
* [Lviv coffee manufacture][lviv-coffee]

For the weekend, Lillia had planned a trip to Ternopil to visit her parents and other relatives. Apparently they don’t
get many foreigners on the train and the attendant on the train made an effort to ask if I wanted tea or coffee in
English. He sort of chuckled and so did my cousins. We took a bus from the train station to the outer area of Ternopil
where Lilias’s parents live. It was a classic pre 90’s looking apartment block. The door opens to their apartment and
I’m welcomed with a feast on the table! Lilia’s parents didn’t speak much English so poor Lilia had to spend a lot of
time translating (she eventually could tell me whole life story without me having to say a word). The meal started with
a shot of vodka. I didn’t know vodka could actually taste good! When Ivan offered me another, I replied “tak, bud
laska!” (translation: yes, please!). That moment signified me as an authentic family member.

First, I need to digress and talk about Lilia and Natalia’s parents, Ivan and Mariia. They are the sweetest couple and
so generous. I loved how they didn’t let the language barrier prevent us from getting to know each other. One of my
favourite moments was sitting with Ivan as he showed me pictures and we had a conversation. Lilia was busy packing 
for the trip back and after she was done she asked what the heck we could possibly talk about. I’m not quite sure
myself, but we laughed a lot and didn’t let language stop use from at least trying to communicate. We even enjoyed
watching the Belgian GP (and what and awesome race!) with some Ukrainian craft beers. One day I hope to learn more
Ukrainian so we can communicate 
even more the next time we meet. Mariia could easily be mistaken as a sister of her daughters. She’s actually my
cousin (Lilia and Natalia are my 2nd cousins 1st removed) and the family bond was definitely felt. She’s also an
amazing cook! The meals included home made: cabbage rolls, perogies, pork fat, sour cream, borscht, milk, and juice.
I’m pretty sure I gained 5 pounds over those few days. 

The next day was spent driving to a village outside of Ternopil. Our first stop was at Mariia’s parents (Hanna and
Fedoz). First we stopped by a house which was a family run brewery. One of the sons of the owner was there and he 
happily (in excellent English) explained the whole operation. The beer was fresh, un-pasterized, un-filtered, and
very tasty. We then arrived and had a big family lunch (with more shots of vodka). Hanna is my dad’s cousin as she
is the daughter of Eve Myu who is the sister of Petro Myu, my dad’s father. The meal was of course fantastic and I
did my best to update them on my family back in Canada. 

After an amazing weekend we headed back to L'viv. Lilia's roommate was returning so I had find a place of my own to
for a few days. I wasn't prepared for how much I would miss being in the same place as my cousins and Vitalik (I'm
close to considering him family). I did feel some sense of relief to give Lilia some time without having to worry
about entertaining me and it gave me a chance to practice my Ukrainian all on my own. The few days I spent on my
own was focused on hanging out in coffee shops and working on a browser plugin. I realized there's a reason why
people smiled when I asked for the wifi password when I hung out at a venue. Trying to be Ukrainian I would say
"Internet but laska". This is the equivalent of ordering the Internet off of a menu. My cousins got a good laugh
from this, and apparently so did all the wait staff I said this to. Anyways, over a couple days I got the the basic
functionality of a plugin working called [BlockWorthy][blockworthy]. It scrubs links to viral websites and issues you a warning
if you happen to go to one of those websites.

Leaving Ukraine I thought about the bonds of family. I had been watching Game of Thrones and seeing how important
bloodlines are in that show probably had some affect on me. I was really touched that my cousins would openly accept
me into their home and all because we share common ancestry. I didn’t even know who were my cousins were until my aunt
in Biggar informed me there are relatives in Ukraine who would love to meet me. The thought about the subconscious
bond with family made me think about why we have countries and lines on maps. It’s like a higher level view of the
bond. Patriotism is like a larger version of nepotism. I can’t help connect more easily with someone from Canada than
I would USA. My bond with my cousins exists because of who my parents are. My ability to nearly walk into any country
is simply because of the country I was born in.

What I’m really trying to say is that I’m so freaking lucky to be born into an awesome family and country. Because
of these uncontrollable events (on my part), I’ve been afforded so many luxuries.
