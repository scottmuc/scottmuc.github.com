Over the last 4 weeks I've been taking the [Coursera][coursera] course [Learning how to Learn][course-homepage] on the
recommendation of my friend [Srini][srini-twitter]. The 2nd assignment in the course is to create a presentation or some
form of media to present an understanding of the topics. An accompaniment to the course is the book,
[A Mind for Numbers][book] by [Barabara Oakley][barbara] (the primary course instructor), which is a short read but very
insightful and full of references. I'm thoroughly enjoying the course and love the concept around the assignment. This
blog is my way of trying to synthesize ideas that are flying around in my head, which is exactly the purpose of the
assignment.

Over my education and career, I feel that I have developed some pretty good habits. The book has confirmed some of these
habits and given me an undertanding around why they work. It's alse able to point out some flaws that I tend to
down-play, but now realize that they are habits I need to deal with.

I began reading the book before taking the course and immediately benefited from a process that is described in the
book. The book on its own is a fantastic resource and is an excellent compliment to the course. I really think taking the
course at the same time instilled a lot of the information far better than if I had only just read the book. I was
surprised when I finished the book because my Kindle reported that I was only 65% complete when I was at the end. Well
that's because the remainder is a massive collection of references of all the research that's been done on all of the
topics! It shows that the content is truly backed by science which is refreshing given all the anecdotal type of
information that's published on the Internet.

## Core Concepts

The material in the book (and the course) were broken up into easy to consume chunks. I can't really cover all of it
here but these are the 3 concepts that really stuck with me.

### Diffuse and Focused Modes of Thinking

You know that experience of when you figure out the solution to a problem you've been struggling with when you're having
a shower in the morning? Well, it's quite a common phenomenon, and it can be explained by science! This is the brain
harnesing it's diffused mode of thinking (which I'll define in a moment). Along with that feeling, ever feel like you're
concentrating on a problem so hard that time seems to accelerate? That's when you're in the focused mode of thinking.

**Focused Mode** - When the brain is in this mode, it's busy building up foundations of material for access later. I
like to think of it as going to the gym. You're exercising ideas and building up their strength. If you don't practice
them deliberately, they can lose strength. Also, if you don't focus on concepts with discipline, you don't effectively
chunk (another concept I'll define later) the concepts.

**Diffuse Mode** - This is where synthesis of ideas (or chunks) happens. Our brain is good at continuing effort solving
problems while our bodies are performing activities like going for a walk, running, socializing, and cooking. This is
why when struggling with a problem late at night, sleeping on it, usually results in some new insights in the morning.
Using the workout analogy, this is like using your in-shape body to enjoy life: traveling, playing with your children,
fixing up your garden.

What's important to understand is that both of these modes can't operate at the same time. I [even wrote][flow-post]
about this a while ago and this book has given me the knowledge to better understand what I was observing when I wrote
that post. As a developer, the state of flow (deep focused mode) has its appeal, but breaking that up so that you can
piece together your new knowledge is also important.

### Chunking

Chunks can be thought of as an abstraction around a collection of specific thoughts. It wasn't mentioned in the book,
but a lot of what I read on chunking looked like reaching the **competent** level on the
[Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition][dreyfus-model]. I'm now curious if **diffuse mode** is an essential part of
becoming **proficent** or an **expert**.

This section of the book has made me realize some flaws in the way I learn and I feel I fall into the trap called
**illusion of competence**. This can be caused by [poor learning practices][10-rules], and I know I am guilty of many of
these. Speaking of the Dreyfus model, Erik Dietrich wrote an awesome article about the
[Advanced Beginner][advanced-beginner], which is another great way of explaining the **illusion of competence**.
