Over the last 4 weeks I've been taking the [Coursera][coursera] course [Learning how to Learn][course-homepage] on the
recommendation of my friend [Srini][srini-twitter]. The 2nd assignment in the course is to create a presentation or some
form of media to present an understanding of the topics. An accompaniment to the course is the book,
[A Mind for Numbers][book] by [Barabara Oakley][barbara] (the primary course instructor), which is a short read but very
insightful and full of references. I'm thoroughly enjoying the course and love the concept around the assignment. This
blog is my way of trying to synthesize ideas that are flying around in my head, which is exactly the purpose of the
assignment.

Over my education and career, I feel that I have developed some pretty good habits. The book has confirmed some of these
habits and given me an undertanding around why they work. It's alse able to point out some flaws that I tend to
down-play, but now realize that they are habits I need to deal with.

I began reading the book before taking the course and immediately benefited from a process that is described in the
book. The book on its own is a fantastic resource and is an excellent compliment to the course. I really think taking the
course at the same time instilled a lot of the information far better than if I had only just read the book. I was
surprised when I finished the book because my Kindle reported that I was only 65% complete when I was at the end. Well
that's because the remainder is a massive collection of references of all the research that's been done on all of the
topics! It shows that the content is truly backed by science which is refreshing given all the anecdotal type of
information that's published on the Internet.
