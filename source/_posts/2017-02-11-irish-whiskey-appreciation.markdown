Over the last month I had the wonderful opportunity of learning all about Irish whiskey. It was held in the
[liquor store][mitchell-and-son] in [The CHQ Building][the-chq] (where I work). If you see them offering it
again I highly recommend it! Not only did I learn a lot about Irish whiskey, I learned a lot about whiskey
in general.

First, a bit of history. It's quite possible that you are screaming at your screen saying that I am spelling
whiskey incorrectly. Chill out. The word originated from the Irish word *[uisce][uisce]* (meaning water). When Scotch
whisky became popular the proud Irish introduced 'e' into the anglicised version of *uisce*, hence whiskey. The USA
often uses this spelling too which may be because of the large amounts of Irish emigration during that time. What's
very clear is that people do spend way too much time arguing about what is the "right" way.

Three of the lessons had brand ambassadors to do a bit of a sales pitch. At least that's what I thought was going
to happen. What I got out of them was that they were deeply passionate about whiskey and its Irish origins. They
loved their competitors liquid and they were happy to be a part of the booming Irish whiskey industry. They were
disappointed about the world view of Irish whiskey. Scotch is perceived as the ultimate whiskey and that Irish whiskey
is only used for shots (and usually only Jameson).

Before we begin let's explain a few key words:

## Week 1 - Pot Still Whiskey

Irish [pot still][pot-still-wiki] whiskey is the traditional way. It's a bit more laborious compared to using a
[continuous still (aka column still)][column-still-wiki].

For traditional Irish pot still whiskey the mash bill is half malted barley and half unmalted barley. The unmalted
barley is there because of tax laws the existed in 1795. This tickles the economist in me because I love seeing how
financial incentives create innovation (the history of British ales and Belgium beer has similar economic origins).

The distilling begins with a fermenting mash heated to a temperature where the alcohol evaporates. The first
distillation isn't pure enough so this gets distilled again. When you read a label that says "triple distilled", it's
because it was distilled in pot stills and you need that third distillation to really extract the cleanest
distilate. Some whiskeys are known and enjoyed for being double distilled, but this usually isn't by design. It's
most likely because of budget since the extra still does cost quite a bit.

The evening started with a collection of whiskies in a circle. In the period of 2 hours we heard the wise words

## Summary

The course was well worth the 160â‚¬. I was surpised at how little I knew before hand and how much preconceived
perceptions I had of whiskey build up.

Now I'm happily building up a small collection of my favourites. Because of this course I feel that I am getting
much better value for the money spent because I am purchasing the whiskeys that best fit what I enjoy. I wouldn't
complain about any of the whiskies I tried, but when it comes to spending your hard earned cash, it's nice to know
a bit about what you're getting.
