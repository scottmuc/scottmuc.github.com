Learning about Irish Whiskey was one of my goals when I decided to move to Dublin. Lucky for me, the
[liquor store][mitchell-and-son] in [The CHQ Building][the-chq] (where I work) offered an Irish Whiskey
Appreciation Course!

## Week 1 - Pot Still Whiskey

## Week 2 - Single Malt Whiskey

## Week 3 - Independent Bottlers

## Week 4 - Blended Whiskey

## Summary

The course was well worth the 160â‚¬. I was surpised at how little I knew before hand and how much preconceived
perceptions I had of whiskey build up.
