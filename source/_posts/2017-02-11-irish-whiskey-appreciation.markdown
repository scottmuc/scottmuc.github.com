Over the last month I had the wonderful opportunity of learning all about Irish whiskey. It was held in the
[liquor store][mitchell-and-son] in [The CHQ Building][the-chq] (where I work). If you see them offering it
again I highly recommend it! Not only did I learn a lot about Irish whiskey, I learned a lot about whiskey
in general.

First, a bit of history. It's quite possible that you are screaming at your screen saying that I am spelling
whiskey incorrectly. Chill out. The word originated from the Irish word *[uisce][uisce]* (meaning water). When Scotch
whisky became popular the proud Irish introduced 'e' into the anglicised version of *uisce*, hence whiskey.

Three of the lessons had brand ambassadors

## Summary

The course was well worth the 160â‚¬. I was surpised at how little I knew before hand and how much preconceived
perceptions I had of whiskey build up.

Now I'm happily building up a small collection of my favourites. Because of this course I feel that I am getting
much better value for the money spent because I am purchasing the whiskeys that best fit what I enjoy. I wouldn't
complain about any of the whiskies I tried, but when it comes to spending your hard earned cash, it's nice to know
a bit about what you're getting.
