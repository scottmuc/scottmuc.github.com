A few years ago I [left ThoughtWorks][leaving-tw] and was considering leaving IT altogether.

Though I’m listing things related to ThoughtWorks, a lot of my weariness is more
from IT in general. It could be an age thing, but I’ve been around long enough to
see a lot of terrible things going on in this industry. No one seems to care about
security, and the innovation that is making billions in the stock market are consumer
products that mean almost nothing to me. It’s hard to be optimistic after Edward
Snowden revealed the NSA privacy issues.
{% endblockquote %}

After a long break and working at a couple more companies I am able to pinpoint some specific behaviours
of individuals that have an affect on my work ethic and general work happiness.

## Contempt Culture (in software)

Recently I read an excellent post about [Contempt Culture][contempt-culture]. What resonated so much with me was that I
remember being that way when I first started my career. I was impressionable and looked up to the veterans that I met at
conferences that appeared to me as people that knew everything. They've seen it all. They would speak with such
authority on all the things and I bought it all. I didn't question, nor probe for reasons.

Nowadays I feel like my attitude is much better (friends, please correct me if I'm wrong), but I still have a lot of room
for improvement. But... I'm now one of those so called veterans I looked up to. I can see how much BS they were spouting
and how overconfident they were.

Reading the quote from my previous blog post reveals the contempt that I was feeling. Do I still feel the same?
Sort of, but my energy is more focused on what I am doing. It feels like a weight off my shoulders.

## How it Affects Me (and how I deal with it)

What I've learnt is that this attitude can suck the energy out of me. When I meet an individual that exhibits these
behaviours I then have contempt for them! This is just as toxic and I'm struggling to deal with it. I rarely engage
with these people because of the energy it takes out of me. Here are some thoughts that come to my head when I
hear dismissive comments:

* My friend made that! I saw what was there before and they have improved it so much!
* If it's so easy why don't you do it?
* You're wasting energy, can we focus on the problem in front of us?
* You're too stupid to understand the complexity of the problem they are trying to solve.

Not so healthy huh? I don't like having these thoughts. They drain me and dampen my motivation. What's worse is that I
find myself absorbing a bit of their attitude and will potentially mimic it.

A [follow up][on-critizing-languages] brought up an interesting observation about identity. The language, tool, framework
becomes an identity of sorts. Let's not even discuss the Editor as an Identity trope.

## Strategies for Handling Contemptuous Individuals

Aurynn's post has a lot of good strategies to handle your own personal contempt, but what I need are ways to handle
other individuals. If I don't, I could see myself getting overly frustrated with the industry again.

* Assume the person is experiencing imposter syndrome.
* Ask why they have such a strong reaction. Pepper with more questions.
* Redirect the focus to the outcomes. Yes, language X has problems, but look how it is helping Y.

The cyncical side of me would like to do the following:

* Immediately agree and suggest changing everything to their utopian dream.
* Acknowledge their brilliance and invite them to keynote a conference.

Note that contempt culture can take many forms. This year has been full of unhealthy thoughts, but this post is
intended to speak specifically about the programming industry.

Clearly I need some assistance with this. Please leave a comment with your strategies.
