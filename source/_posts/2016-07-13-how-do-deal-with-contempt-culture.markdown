A few years ago I [left ThoughtWorks][leaving-tw] and was considering leaving IT altogether.

Though I’m listing things related to ThoughtWorks, a lot of my weariness is more from IT in general.
It could be an age thing, but I’ve been around long enough to see a lot of terrible things going on in
this industry. No one seems to care about security, and the innovation that is making billions in the
stock market are consumer products that mean almost nothing to me. It’s hard to be optimistic after
Edward Snowden revealed the NSA privacy issues.

After a long break and working at a couple more companies I was able to pinpoint some specific behaviours
of individuals that really drained my energy.

## Contempt Culture

Recently I read an excellent post about [Contempt Culture][contempt-culture]. What resonated so much with me was that I
remember being that way when I first started my career. I was impressionable and looked up to the veterans that I met at
conferences that appeared to me as people that knew everything. They've seen it all. They would speak with such
authority on all the things and I bought it all. I didn't question, nor probe for reasons.

Nowadays I feel like my attitude is much better (friends, please correct me if I'm wrong), but I still have a lot of room
for improvement. But... I'm now one of those so called veterans I looked up to. I can see how much BS they were spouting
and how overconfident they were.

What I've learnt is that this culture can suck the energy out of me. When I meet an individual that exhibits these
behaviours I then have contempt for them! This is just as toxic and I'm struggling to deal with it. Here are the
feelings that come to mind when I hear contemptous statements:

* My friend made that! I saw what was there before and they have improved it so much!
* If it's so easy why don't you do it?
* You're wasting energy, can we focus on the problem in front of us?
* You're too stupid to understand the complexity of the problem they are trying to solve.

Not so healthy huh? I don't like having these thoughts. They drain me and dampen my motivation. What's worse is that I
find myself absorbing a bit of their attitude and will potentially mimic it.

A [follow up][on-critizing-languages] brought up an interesting observation about identity. Ever ask someone which
editor they prefer? I love responding this now saying I'm editor agnostic. Honestly, I do have a preference, but that's
not relevent for the goals I'm trying to achieve. The goal is to write some software that provides values, right? Value
can mean many things. You could value the exercise, challenge, or the functionality.

## Strategies to Handle Individuals

Aurynn's post has a lot of good strategies to handle your own personal contempt, but what I need are ways to handle
other individuals. If I don't I could see myself getting overly frustrated with the industry again.

* Assume the person is experience imposter syndrome.
* Ask why they have such a strong reaction. Pepper with more questions.
* Immediately agree and suggest changing everything to their utopian dream.
* Acknowledge their brilliance and invite them to keynote a conference.

Clearly I need some assistance with this. Please leave a comment with your strategies.
