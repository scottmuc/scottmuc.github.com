## Background

[The Day the Universe Changed][wiki-page] is a documentary ([9.1 on imdb][imdb])
from 1985 that covers the effects of science and technology on western
society. I was introduced to the show in grade 8 social studies and I clearly
didn't appreciate the message of the documentary when I was 13-14 years old.

The lessons in the show seem to have come to mind several times in the last
month. I've watched the series again to refresh my understanding and I am
continually surprised by how a 35 year old documentary can still resonate today!

Unfortunately it's not viewable online. However, this [first 10 minutes][10-min]  of the first episode should be enough to get your gears turning. In short, it's
about trying to understand how do we know what we know and how has it shaped us
to be who we are.

**note**: When I use words like **us** and **we** I mean people who've grown up
in a [western society][western] context. This type of documentary focusing on
other cultural backgrounds would be amazing!

## Relevance Today

For some reason this documentary came up several times over the last month in
at least 3 separate conversations. That's what triggered me write this post
today.

Two conversations were around folks watching the [Flat Earther][flat-earther]
documentary on Netflix. I haven't watched the documentary, but I always thought
considering a model where the Earth is flat is an interesting brain buzzle.
Like the intro linked earlier alludes to, if the Earth was flat, how would that
change what we perceive? If a child asked me to explain why the world is a
sphere (and we know that's not entirely correct either), how can I do that? I
simply take it as fact. I only understand (and could explain) a tiny fraction
of my everyday life and I can still live a thriving life.

After listening to yet another excellent [Econtalk][econtalk] podcast episode
about [mastery, specialization, and range][range-episode], I learnt about
how pre-modern people sometimes cannot make logical reasoning based on abstractions. For example, if you say *"the ground in Yellowknife is frozen
solid most of the year, would it be suitable for farming?"*, their answer
would be *"I don't know, I've never seen Yellowknife"*. Despite the clue that
would suggest a reasonable answer of *"No, I can't imagine a place with frozen
ground growing crops"*, they base their answers on first hand experience. Yet another reminder to step out of one's own brain to understand how much trust (faith) we put in our abstractions.

## Religion vs Science?

I enjoyed how the show didn't pit religion against science. To me it showcased
that they both can have the same goals in mind. Give you what you need in order
to make decisions with your life. It strengthens the statement
[*"Everybody worships"*][everybody-worships] said by
[David Foster Wallace][david-foster-wallace] in 2005 at the Kenyon College commencement address.

Science is still limited in that it cannot quite decribe the "why" of so many
things. It's great that we have Philosophy to go to when feeling lost.

## Reflections

Rewatching this today reminded me that I'm much less sure about everything
these days than I was before. But that's a good thing, because I was overly
certain about things before.

If you're in Berlin and would like to watch the whole series, let me know. I
may update this post with watching notes next time I go through the series.
Which is something I will be revisiting frequently now.
