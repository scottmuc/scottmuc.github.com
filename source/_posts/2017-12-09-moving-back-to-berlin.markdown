Remember that [post][moving-dublin] from almost a couple years ago? Consider this a tiny `git revert --no-commit` of that, modify it slightly to keep my location as Berlin but Pivotal as my employer.

## A Pivotal Moment

The whole process started with a strong desire to move back to Berlin. I was willing to look for a different job but I really really didn't want to. Pivotal has been fantastic and I've enjoyed it there. Since I joined I've worked on 3 different teams:

* **[Ops Manager][ops-manager]** - A web platform for managing all the products offered on the [Pivotal Network][pivnet] (think of this as an AppStore for Ops Manager)
* **Release Engineering** - A team responsible for packaging all the components of [Cloud Foundry][cloudfoundry] in a [package][ert] that can install in **Ops Manager**. Now they support even more products and the automation to sustain it all is really impressive!
* **[RabbitMQ for PCF][rabbitmq4pcf]** - This is where I spent the bulk of my time (18 months). For part of the time I played software developer and for the majority of the time I played product manager. Either role had a myriad of activities that cover the many facets of software delivery so I enjoyed this time very much.

[rabbitmq4pcf]: https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-rabbitmq
[cloudfoundry]: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/
[ert]: https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime

In all of these projects I got to work with great people who challenged me and allowed me to challenge them as well. The products themselves are also quite interesting and are gaining a lot of traction in the market. Cloud Foundry is something I would have enjoyed using if my primary activity was writing application code.

So, when I mentioned my desire to move to my manager, Jamie Monseratt (he's an ok fella), he responded with support and positivity. I was able to explore the different things I could do in Berlin and eventually landed on a role called [Platform Reliability Engineer][pre] (we're hiring). It feels like it'll be a fun mix of enablement, hands on operations, and customer engagement. I've learned that I love running software more than the building software so this appears to be a great fit for me.

## Dublin

Living in Dublin was a great experience. I've learned all about [irish whiskey][irish-whiskey] which is now my favourite spirit. I've made some friends and have visited more pubs than I can possible count. I'm going to miss all the concert venues which became my home away from home in the city.

## Settling Down

What I really love about this move is that it's the first time I've ever moved back to a place. The best way I can describe why is that Berlin had the most gravity to me. Every location has a bit of gravity: Vancouver, San Francisco, Bangalore; But Berlin had sufficient gravity to pull me out of Dublin.

In my head this is the last move I'm going to be doing voluntarily. I wish to settle down in Berlin and make it the first place I've lived in for longer than 2 years since I lived in Vancouver (which implies I haven't lived in the same city for longer than 18 months in the last 8 years).

In my first week in Berlin I've found my new home. It's an interesting flat in Wilmersdorf. It's large, has lots of character, and is well connected to all of Berlin. I look forward to having you over :-)
