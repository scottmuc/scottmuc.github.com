### Hungary for More (Siófok/Tihany)

Remember the woman that I met at the [Dream Theater concert][budapest-post]? We have kept in touch and she promised to show me around the
Hungarian country side! She recommended [Balaton Lake][balaton-lake] area so I found a [place to stay][airbnb] in [Siófok][siofok] and worked
on scheduling a day to meet up.

Unfortunately the weather did not cooperate as it rained most of the time I was there. On the plus side, I picked up a
cold on my way from Ukraine and wasn't feeling very adventurous anyways. I spent 3 days enjoying the sound of the rain,
and watching all of the Harry Potter movies. I picked up some groceries the day I arrived and was able to be pretty
self-sufficient.

On the last day my cold was disappearing and the sun came out. Just in time for my meet up with Orsolya and a tour of
[Veszprém][veszprem] and [Tihany][tihany]. Both places had the European charm that I've enjoyed so much on this trip.
The sun came out while walking around Inner Lake (3rd picture below). Orsolya explained what life is like in rural Hungary
and I shared stories of my life. My favourite question was when she asked how I planned my travels. I never really
thought about it, but I replied saying that it was just a combination of many little trips. With each little trip I had
to plan the transition to the next trip and the opened up opportunities for other little trips.

After the day I was feeling recovered from my cold, and happy to have a new friend. Then I headed back to Budapest to
catch a flight to Milano for the last F1 in my travels.

### Italian Grand Prix (Milano)

Figured that I could fit one more F1 race in this trip! I used some points to get a [free hotel][marriott] in Milano. The
commute to the race track is pretty long so I didn't really have much time to explore the city. [Srini][srini], who went
to the [British GP][british-post] with me, got his [Shengen visa][shengen-visa] and was finally able to explore outside
of Istanbul and the UK. He couldn't come to the race but we got to hang out in the evenings when our respective daily
activities were done.

At the race track there's an abundance of people playing versions of the [shell game][shell-game] . I watched it for
a bit and thought it looked pretty easy. I played once and was absolutely sure of my pick and lost 50 euros. I realized
I got scammed and was initially upset. Then I realized why I played the game. I wanted to win some easy money; how was I
any different to the perpetrators of the scam? It reminded me that no matter how "good" you try to be, tempatation is
always there. I thought I could win a quick buck and I was being just as greedy as the scam artists. I laugh at the
experience now, and see it as a valuable lesson. I spent some time watching these games and saw all the tricks they play
and now understand why it's called a "confidence game". I could see ways to "win", but I would be playing against a
person who plays for hours everyday. I think their confidence will win in the long run.

As I alluded to earlier, the commute to my seat was quite long. My record time to my seat was 1 hour and 40 minutes, but
it was 2 hours most of the time. One of the nice things about F1 is that they aren't too strict about what you can bring
to the track. Each day I bought food from a local grocery store. Below is a picture of my breakfast on race day (yes
beer at 9:00am, don't judge). Buying from the on track vendors is a complete rip-off. For the price of a couple beers, I
was stocked up for the day.

As for the race, the weekend was full of awesome moments. I watched both GP2 and GP3 races, and the F1 race was full of
awesome passes. I was sitting at the first turn which is at the end of a very fast straight ([circuit diagram][track]).
Hopefully this historic track doesn't close, but I am so happy to I got to experience Monza before anything happens to
the event.

Of course my travels wouldn't be complete without meeting up with [Ilias Bartolini][ilias], a ThoughtWorker I met when I
was in India. He's on a project in Milano and we caught up over dinner at [Maruzzella][pizza]. Again, a reminder of the
network that grew out of working at ThoughtWorks is global and full of such wonderful people.

### Turkish Delight

The last leg of my European travels is a stay in [Istanbul][istanbul] (not Constantinople). There's a bit ThoughtWorks
project there and was able to stay in [Srini][srini] and [Toy's][toy] apartment (picture of the view to the right).
I wasn't sure how long I was going to be there so it was night to have the flexibility of a ThoughtWorker's accomodation.

The reason for the uncertain length is that I would be applying for my [Indian visa][indian-visa] from here. I won't go
into too much detail, but the process was relatively painless. The website is horrible and doesn't work in all browsers,
but once I got my application submitted, the rest of the process was straighforward. In a little over a week I got my
visa.

At this point in time I was beginning the interview process for several organizations. Much of my time was spent doing
coding exercises and submitting them, or doing calls. I really felt things were going forward and that in some time I'll
actually have figured out where I'll be living after all of this traveling.

It was a bit of a mini reunion with several people too. I met up with [David Simon][dps], who I climbed Kilimanjaro
with. There was also a bit of a Calgary reunion where I met up with [Isa Goksu](http://isa.io/) who was my roommate for
over a year and I probably hadn't seem him in over 2 years! When I met up with Isa, [Cengiz Han](http://www.cengizhan.com/)
was also there, smoking sheesha. He was also in Calgary (usually complaining about the cold) yet both of them talked
about how much they miss the Calgary days.

Oh right, I'm in Istanbul! In the slack time, I spent many days wandering around this incredible city. My friend
**Rose** has a [picture filled post][rose-blog] that better captures the beauty of the city (and of other European
cities I've visited).
