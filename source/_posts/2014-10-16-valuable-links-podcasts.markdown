It's quite surprising that I haven't really brought up the topic of [podcasts][podcast-wiki] on my blog considering that
I've been consuming them for almost 10 years! My methods and taste have changed a lot over the years, but I want a place
to point people when asked about what podcasts I listen to, and with a little more context than just a pure list.

## Software / Tools

A podcast is such a simple concept (from the technical side) that it allows for a lot of tools and applications to be
created around the idea. Nowadays I pretty much use a single application on my phone. I'm generally only concerned with
the mobile experience since I try to listen to podcasts when I'm on the move and when I'm not focusing on work. Ask me
to listen to a podcast while programming and you'll discover that I won't be able to recall anything from the podcast
(or that I don't do any programming). The application I use is [PocketCasts][pocketcasts]. The homepage is full of
hyperbole and non-truthes (eg: ... deliver the updates instantly...), but it's an alright application and fits my needs for
now. Most importantly, it allows me to export my subscribed shows as an [OPML file][opml-wiki] which I've made
[available to you][podcasts-opml].

## The List

Podcasts are a great way to tap into interests of all different types. You'll notice that only a few are related to my
professional life. Something that's occured to me is that listening to podcasts is a wonderful activity and I do get a
lot out of them, there becomes a point where you've found too much good content and there isn't enough time to listen to
them all.

### Economics

[EconTalk][podcast-econtalk]: I begun listening to this show at the beginning of my [career break][career-break]. The
host, [Russ Roberts][russ-roberts], does a great job of letting the guests speak without pushing his views too often.
It's honestly changed how I think about problems in the world and how to best approach them. Economics is becoming a
tool that I use to help me understand how things are, and how to possibly alter them.

[Freakonomics Radio][podcast-freakonomics]: Sometimes hit or miss. Strives to be entertaining more than educational
sometimes, but overall the content is quite good. I identify a bit with [Steve Levitt][steve-levitt] as he's more of an
intrspective quiet person.

[Planet Money][podcast-planet-money]: Short and to the point episodes that focus on very specific topics or issues. I
like this show because the pieces are bite-sized and frequently released. I find myself listening to this show when I
have to wait 15 minutes before something.

### Startups

[a16z][podcast-a16z]: Getting into the startup world is not something I'm terribly interested in, but I am critical
about the tech community, especially startups. This show helps me better understand the world of startups so I can
better understand the mechanics of startups.

[StartUp][podcast-startup]: A podcast about a podcast startup. It mixes so many of my favourite things into one show.
Fantastic storytelling about a medium I'm passionate about and a domain that I want to learn more of. What connects
me to the show is that [Adam][adam] just wants to work on something he's passionate about, but has to wade through all
sorts of concerns completely separate from what he really wants to do, because that's business.

### Culture and Curiosities

[Tapestry][podcast-tapestry]: Getting into the spiritual side a bit. This show talks about culture and religion with an
open mind. The show reminds me to appreciate the differences between all of us on this rock.

[White Coat Black Art][podcast-white-coat-black-art]: The health care system is usually a bit of a black box and this
show provides some visibility into how things work.

[RadioLab][podcast-radiolab]: One of the pioneers in story-telling podcasts.

[TED Radio Hour][podcast-ted-radio-hour]: Episodes are themed around TED talks of similar topics. It blends interviews
with the speakers along with their talks. I find this more rich than the talk on its own.

[99% Invisible][podcast-99pi]: Now one of my favourites. You never know what to expect with this show because the
enigmatic host, [Roman Mars][roman-mars], always finds something interesting that you likely have no idea about.

### Music

[CBC Radio 3][podcast-cbcradio3]: It's likely that I'm a bit biased, but this is where I discover new music. I worked
there from 2005-2009 during the rise of the podcast. I can attest to the quality of the curation of the content coming
from the folks at Radio 3.

[Song Exploder][podcast-song-exploder]: This show satifies my curiosity about how a song gets made. It also makes me
appreciate songs that I wouldn't have given a second listen. By listening to this show, you can disover new artists, and
you'll learn how to listen to music and grow appreciation for the more subtle elements of song composition.

### Tech / Programming

[Spark][podcast-spark]: A Canadian look into the technical world.

[Giant Robots Smashing into Other Giant Robots][podcast-giant-robots]: Not quite a technical podcast, but it shares
stories from the software development world. I became a fan of [Ben Orenstein][ben-orenstein] when I saw him do a
play-by-play screencast. He strikes me as someone I would enjoy working with.

[The Ship Show][podcast-ship-show]: Co-started by an old on-line friend of mine, [Yousuf Elkany][yousuf]. I like the
conversational style of this show as a way to keep me in the loop in the world of [DevOps][devops].

[HealthyHacker][podcast-healthyhacker]: This one is fairly new and I've already become a fan. [Chris Hunt][chris-hunt]
delivers his show in a charming style. He discusses being healthy, and what's interesting in the software world. All to
the tune of a catchy theme song.

## Summary

There are a lot of podcasts here and I'm constantly re-evaluating which ones should remain. Finding the balance of time
and value is hard to figure out. Currently I'm unemployed making it a lot easier to consume this much content.

listening software.
