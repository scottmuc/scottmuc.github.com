### When in Rome

When I learned that my uncle and his family would be in Rome I looked at my schedule to see if I could make seeing them
work. It turned out it fit perfectly! The last time I saw them was in London while they were doing their 2013 summer
trip and I was on my Belgian Grand Prix vacation. My aunt and uncle are well versed in the world of business so we had
many evenings discussing what I've learned from the economics courses and floating ideas of what's next for my life. Of
course I got to catch up with my cousins too. Can't believe how quickly they are growing up (I won't mention that I
remember seeing them in diapers to avoid their embarassment).  They had rented a flat near the Spanish Steps which made
it easy for me to cram in a bunch of sight-seeing in a short amount of time.

Touring Rome is pretty easy because all you have to do is step outside. Even on my first walk I stumbled across many
interersting sites. I did a couple free walking tours, but they weren't organized by Sandeman and weren't nearly the
same quality. Still, it was good to have a guided walk to the Colloseum and to the Vatican.

As beautiful as Rome was, I knew my time as a tourist was ending. I was at the point where I didn't want to elbow my
way through tourists anymore. Nor was I as interested as I was before in exploring musuems and historical places.

### Swiss Bliss

The other part that made Rome convenient was that I could travel to Switzerland to meet up with fellow ex-ThoughtWork
Marc Hofer, who I worked with in India in ThoughtWorks University (TWU). He had a 1L bottle of scotch ready (we numbed our
heads with scotch nearly every evening during TWU). Thankfully he was generous enough to give me a couch for as long as
I needed one. I ended up spending 10 days in beautiful Thun!

I spent most of my days reading and catching up on my blog writing (it's surprising how long these take to write).
Though I did spend a day biking to Interlaken and another day visiting Geneve, Zurich, and Luzern by train.
