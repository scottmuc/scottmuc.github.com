## Reflections on [2018](/my-resolutions-for-2018/)

This will be easy because I didn’t set any goals last year! It felt great to take a break from goal setting
because 2018 was a big year of transition. I [moved yet again][moving-again] and I started a new role at work.
I then found that it didn’t fit me and I finally had some self awareness to reach out for help and was able
to switch roles again to something that suits me at this moment in time.

Here are some things I discovered about myself in 2018:

* Working from home for the first time and I absolutely love it! I don't believe I'll ever go back to
  having a regular commute again.
* My travel hunger has been satiated. I will be minimizing my travel until my appetite grows for it.
* Berlin is truly where I want to settle down in the long term. So much so that I’ve bought a home
  here and will be moving in a month or so.

## Goals for 2019:

This year is less about figuring out my goals but more about vocalizing them. I intend to measure these to
see if I am making any progress.

* Savings rate of 50%
* Publish a full game recording
* Register for a German course

## Summary

2018 is going to be a year of settling down and some reflection. I'm happy to have found a home where I'm excited by the
prospect of being there for many years. I'm just going to let that feeling spawn iniatives as the year goes on.

Journaling has been the one habit that I’ve cultivated and has lasted several years! Here are the numbers:
