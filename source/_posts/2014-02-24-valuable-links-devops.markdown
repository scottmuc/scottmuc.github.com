## Valuable Links for Devops

TL;DR - Watch [this][the-devops-transformation] video

Since I first learned the term devops 4 years ago I've gone through many leaps in understanding. As a software
developer, I find delivering frequently highly motivating. Devops is a set of principles and practices that aim to
ensure delivery goes as smooth as possible. I found this post, [A Scientific Basis For Devops Success][devops-success],
to be a great introduction to why devops is important.

## People

This list isn't comprehensive, but you can't go wrong by reading what these people have to say:

* [Patrick Debois][jedi4ever] - coined the term devops

* [John Allspaw][john-allspaw] - has many excellent posts on the culture of devops
* [Gene Kim][gene-kim] - co-author of The Phoenix Project
* [Jez Humble][jez-humble] - co-author of Continuous Delivery

## Devops is not a Role

It took me a while to realize that devops is not a role played on a team and that it's got more in commong with Agile in
the fact that it's a collection of principles rather than straight up proceesses.

* [CAMS][cams] - [John Willis][john-willis]' posts a list of principles
* [Lusis' rant][lusis-rant] - an excellent rant about the absurditity of devops being a role
