## Valuable Links for Devops

TL;DR - Watch [this][the-devops-transformation] video

Since I first learned the term devops 4 years ago I've gone through many leaps in understanding. I really wish I saw
[this video (history of devops)][history-devops] before I got involved. As a software developer, I find delivering
frequently highly motivating. Devops is a set of principles and practices that aim to ensure delivery goes as smooth
as possible. I found this post, [A Scientific Basis For Devops Success][devops-success], to be a great introduction
to why devops is important.

It took me a while to realize that devops is not a role played on a team and that it's got more in commong with Agile in
the fact that it's a collection of principles rather than straight up proceesses.
