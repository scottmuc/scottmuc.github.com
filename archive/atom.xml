    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Music has been a big part of my life since at least 1990. It was a great bonding
moment with my oldest brother as we both got into They Might Be Giants &ndash; Flood
at the same time (and independently). He got me into going to concerts, and
indie music.</p>

<p>My joy and participation in music has been a constant and I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed
sharing my experiences and discoveries. This is my attempt at turning what is
usually an e-mail to a few friends into a blog post.</p>

<h2>The Return of Concerts</h2>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/concerts/tickets-2023.jpg"><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/concerts/tickets-2023.small.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>With the pandemic restrictions behind, it was great to see the return of concerts
to Berlin. There are several concerts per day and there were many events I had
to decline. Still, I managed to make it out to the following gigs:</p>

<ul>
<li>24.03.2023 The Handsome Family at <a href="https://privatclub-berlin.de">Privatclub</a></li>
<li>05.04.2023 Moon Hooch at <a href="https://www.urbanspree.com">Urban Spree</a></li>
<li>07.04.2023 Aldous Harding at <a href="https://www.admiralspalast.theater">Admiralpalast</a></li>
<li>23.04.2023 Altin Gün at <a href="https://columbiahalle.berlin/">Columbiahalle</a></li>
<li>29.04.2023 Dry Cleaning at <a href="https://festsaal-kreuzberg.de/en">Festsaal Kreuzberg</a></li>
<li>23.05.2023 The Lemon Twigs at <a href="https://frannz.eu">Frannz Club</a></li>
<li>04.06.2023 The Beths at <a href="https://frannz.eu">Frannz Club</a></li>
<li>06.06.2023 Ghost at <a href="https://www.velodrom.de/en/">Velodrom</a></li>
<li>11.06.2023 Melvins at <a href="https://metropol-berlin.de">Metropol</a></li>
<li>14.06.2023 The War on Drugs at <a href="https://www.zitadelle-berlin.de">Zitadelle Spandau</a></li>
<li>15.08.2023 King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard at <a href="https://www.e-werk-cologne.com">E-Werk</a></li>
<li>24.09.2023 NoSo at <a href="https://www.berghain.berlin/en/">Berghain Kantine</a></li>
<li>26.10.2023 King Krule at <a href="https://columbiahalle.berlin/">Columbiahalle</a></li>
<li>11.10.2023 Grails at <a href="http://www.roadrunners-paradise.de">Roadrunners Rock &amp; Motor Club</a></li>
<li>18.10.2023 Tangerine Dream at <a href="https://www.admiralspalast.theater">Admiralspalast</a></li>
<li>29.10.2023 Kvelertak at <a href="https://hole-berlin.de">Hole 44</a></li>
<li>09.11.2023 Richard Dawson at <a href="https://www.berghain.berlin/en/">Berghain Kantine</a></li>
<li>24.11.2023 GoGo Penguin at <a href="https://huxleysneuewelt.de">Huxleys Neue Welt</a></li>
<li>09.12.2023 Great Lake Swimmers at <a href="https://larkberlin.com">Lark</a></li>
<li>12.12.2023 The Rural Alberta Advantage at <a href="https://privatclub-berlin.de">Privatclub</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Ghost and Tangerine Dream feel like the highlights to me. Something about these
shows felt really special. Regardless, there wasn&rsquo;t a bad show in this list.
All were enjoyable and many were attended by friends as well (half I went to alone).
It&rsquo;s also interesting to see I didn&rsquo;t go to any venue more than twice.</p>

<h2>Music Discovery</h2>

<p>Over time I&rsquo;ve found a sustainable way of discovering new music without feeling
too overwhelmed. The <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510019/all-songs-considered">All Songs Considered podcast</a> has been a great source of
music curation that I&rsquo;ve followed since 2016. Over the year I add noteworthy
songs to a playlist on YouTube. Over the last few days I&rsquo;ve narrowed these picks
down to something that can be listened to in a session. My pick for 2023 have a
nostalgic tone for me. As well as a tilt towards female vocalists.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the playlist. I tried to organise it in a way that makes for an enjoyable
musical journey.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This was fun to write and I find the exercise of citing the source of the song
enjoyable. Let me know if you would like me to retroactively do similar posts
going back a few years.</p>

    <link href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/a-fresh-start-in-midlife/"/>
    <updated>2023-04-17T19:12:53+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/a-fresh-start-in-midlife</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over a year ago <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/life-work-covid/">I posted a life update</a>, and now it’s time for another! In Nov 2021 I hinted about a
new job I was starting. So let&rsquo;s go back a year and see how that developed.</p>

<h2>2022</h2>

<h3>Entering ClimatePartner</h3>

<p>The cliffhanger that I ended the last post with was getting a job with <a href="https://www.climatepartner.com/">ClimatePartner</a> as a team lead.
A team lead in this context was a mix of tech leadership and people management. Along with that, I was bootstrapping the
technical organisation in the Berlin office. The job began in Jan of 2022.</p>

<p>Several months were spent learning about the organisation, the mission, and what role software had to play. It came
clear early on that going back to a full 40hr work week wasn’t something I want to regress (I went to 32hr weeks for the
last 8 months or so at VMware) on and thankfully was able to switch to a 32hr work week a few months in.</p>

<p>The Berlin team wasn’t going to appear from thin air so a lot of my time was spent interviewing candidates. It wasn’t
until June of 2022 that the first new hire of Berlin was coming to the office. New hires would be added to the roster
every single month until the end of the year!</p>

<h3>Permanent Residency</h3>

<p>In the meantime, I also managed to get my <a href="https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/en/residence/permanent/">German Permanent Residency title</a>! This was a huge milestone and
has been a goal of mine for a couple years. This was one of the reasons I needed to be working again. As articulated in
my last post, permanent residency wasn’t the only goal of employment, but an aligned benefit.</p>

<p>The feeling of relief and freedom after acquiring this permit is hard to describe. To keep it short, acquiring permanent
residence means I can live in Germany without being employed. Otherwise, I would be reverting back to a tourist visa
which has a limit of 3 months. Now a myriad of of life possibilities were in my field of view that were previously
obscurred by the work permit requirement.</p>

<p>Again, a huge thank you goes to <a href="http://www.legal-links.net/en/">Legal Links</a>, specifically <a href="http://www.legal-links.net/en/anwaeltinnen/juliane-linke/">Juliane Linke</a> and
<a href="http://www.legal-links.net/en/anwaeltinnen/sophie-baumann/">Sophie Baumann</a>, who were a joy to work with and experts in their field. Money well spent.</p>

<h3>Covid Again</h3>

<p>As mentioned in my last update, I had the OG Covid and it was horrible. Over a year had passed and I still didn’t have
my taste/smell back 100%. In June of 2022 I caught Covid again. It hit me like a ton of bricks again, but thankfully it
was a shorter stint. I fully lost my taste/smell again too. The odd thing is; when the taste/smell came back, it
returned much stronger than before I caught Covid the second time!</p>

<p>I did a little travelling in Feb/Mar of 2023 and I noticed that my taste/smell were still improving. Perhaps it was
being in the same place for 3 years that desensitised me. I wouldn’t say I’m back 100% but I’m back sufficiently enough
that I can enjoy a much wider selection of food and drink, so much so that it’s made dining out pleasurable again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I still wonder what the long-term negative impact of having Covid will have on me going forward.</p>

<h3>Shelly Passing Away</h3>

<p>Sadly, Shelly passed away during this time. I knew adopting an old cat would have a shorter time span, but 3 years was
shorter than expected. Not much to say other than it was a very difficult time for me. I’ll get another cat at some
point but not sure when.</p>

<p><em>Saying farewell, now her ashes are on a shelf in an urn with all my other relics</em></p>

<h3>Lack of Motivation and A Fork in the Road</h3>

<p>At this point (Aug 2022), I was feeling like something wasn’t quite right. My motivation was down, and I couldn’t say my
surroundings or people were the cause of it. I felt like I didn’t fit in with what I was doing. It wasn’t quite
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter-syndrome</a> because I felt competent at what I was doing. In the end, I am questioning my current
career direction.</p>

<p>I couldn’t have predicted the feeling of empowerment the permanent residency gave me. During a train trip in August (my
first real trip since Nov 2019), I gave a thought to my current life/work trajectory. Some books I read during the trip
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wild Problems</strong> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4955007503">my review</a>) by Russ Roberts and <strong>Transformative Experience</strong>
(<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4955068988">my review</a>) by L.A. Paul &mdash; These two books gave me the confidence to make a risky decision and
a bold choice.</li>
<li><strong>Midlife</strong> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5007684093">my review</a>) by Kieran Setiya &mdash; Helped me understand that many people feel this way at this
point in their life. It gave me a language to understand my lack of motivation.</li>
</ul>


<p>Over the course of the trip I felt I had to make a decision on whether or not to leave ClimatePartner or stay. By the
end of the trip, I decided that I needed to leave! I think my book review of Midlife describes my rationale for my
decision. To summarise, I want to take some time to explore work outside my bailiwick. Though I can’t deny a decreased
interest in my current industry. Identifying what my issues are with &ldquo;current industry&rdquo; will need to be explored and
written about in a future time.</p>

<h3>Leaving ClimatePartner</h3>

<p>The decision to leave was made in August and I gave my notice in September. This meant I would be working until the end
of the year (3 month notice period). Little did I know how much the remaining months would test me.</p>

<p>As each month passed, the vibe and culture in the Berlin office was becoming incredibly rich, fun, and energising. I was
extremely proud of the people that I was a large part in bringing to ClimatePartner Berlin but was feeling guilt and
sadness for leaving them so early. It also tested my decision to leave. I’m glad it was difficult though because despite
the incredible people and team I was leaving, I still felt in my gut that I was doing the right thing.</p>

<p>During my last days the teams gave me the most amazing farewell I could have imagined. I didn’t want to do much and I
suggested a graveyard walk as a group activity (I learned earlier that many others on the team like strolling in
graveyards too). They turned it into a funeral ceremony for me and even read a eulogy to my departure! They also gave me
this hilarious conversation guide (see below, inspired by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/ouk0js/how_to_talk_like_boromir/">How to talk like Boromir</a>). Below are also a couple
lovely pictures of the spirit of the office and colleagues, and I am proud of the framed picture the team gave me as my
final gift. Sadly, ClimatePartner laid off 50% (Feb 2023) of the folks in Berlin so several of the people in the picture
are now looking for work).</p>

<p><em>How to sound like me!, Digital Solutions Berlin at Christmas, post graveyard festivities in a Christmas market</em></p>

<p>Like <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/joining-soundcloud-and-moving-to-berlin/">SoundCloud</a>, ClimatePartner was on the shorter side of employment stints I’ve had, but impactful.
Building up the teams in Berlin has been one of the most rewarding things I’ve done in my career. But now it’s time to
move on.</p>

<h2>2023</h2>

<h3>Goal Revisiting</h3>

<p>To start the year, I thought it would be good to revisit the goals I stated <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-resolutions-for-2021/">back in 2021</a>. I’ve had a
dubious history of goal setting on this blog but nevertheless do ok in progressing or course correcting. Here’s the
progress made so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>✔️  <strong>Permanent Residence</strong> &mdash; Complete! Things really fell apart on this in 2021, but happy to have ended 2022 with
this special entitlement.</li>
<li>✔️  <strong>Winding Down Work</strong> &mdash; Complete! I was working 4 days a week with VMware from Apr 2021. Likewise, I was doing
the same with ClimatePartner in 2022. Now I’m unemployed and revisiting my relationship with income and work.</li>
<li>🚧 <strong>Cycling Initiative</strong> &mdash; This hasn’t gone so well. I was tracking progress in 2021 and was doing some significant
rides, but this regressed in 2022.</li>
<li>🚧 <strong>Launch Personal Finance Website</strong> &mdash; The extra time has worked well in helping me better understand what I want
to build.</li>
</ul>


<p>Feels good to have a couple of these significant goals checked off, and decent progress made on the others. I plan on
continuing with the unfinished goals and reflect on goal setting in 2023.</p>

<h3>Starting Career Break #2</h3>

<p>So… Now what?</p>

<p>Digesting the books I read over August, and the emotional test of my decision to leave ClimateParter, gave me a lot to
reflect on. I knew I wasn’t getting the same satisfaction from my career as I was previously. I was on autopilot for a
bit, and at some point was at a place where I wasn’t sure I liked doing my job, despite all the good feelings I had
about my colleagues and work environment.</p>

<p>On the train ride back home in August, I asked myself one simple question: “How would you feel if you were at
ClimatePartner 5 years from now?”. My immediate answer to myself was “regret”. I would regret not having the courage to
pursue all the things that don’t exist on my current career direction.</p>

<p>So… I am going to explore those things. I don&rsquo;t have much of a plan, but now I have the space to explore. I intend to
rediscover the things I intrinsically am motivated to do. Over the last few months, this has narrowed down to 3 specific
topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Personal finance mindset and modelling</li>
<li>Gaming (development, playing, reviewing, designing)</li>
<li>Personal IT infrastructure aka SmallOps</li>
</ul>


<p>I can’t really say specifically what I’ll end up doing, but those are 3 topics that I can effortlessly research,
explore, tinker, share, and educate. My only plan is to see where these interests take me for the next little while.</p>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/blog/categories/career-break/">My last career break</a> was a special time in my life. The context was different then; I was younger,
didn’t have a fixed address. This time around, I have a home that I love. My travel ambitions are smaller and nearer.
I’m going to travel in mind and spirit more this time around, and less physically.</p>

<p>That being said, I did take 3 weeks to travel by rail and ferry to Brussels, London, Cardiff/Swansea, Liverpool, Dublin.
So physical travel isn’t completely out:</p>

<h3>Following My Updates</h3>

<p>I understand that being absent from social media has made it harder for everyone to keep tabs on what I&rsquo;m up to, so I&rsquo;m
going to re-evaluate how to broadcast updates in a humane way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a while since I’ve done a general life update. I’m no longer active on social media and have left a lot of
people out of what’s going on in my life. One effect of my lack of posting was that my immediate family didn’t know
much about my day-to-day life. Social media used to be good for this type of communication until it became more of an
opinion soap-box.</p>

<p>This post is for all those I’ve lost touch with.</p>

<p>Let’s treat my last <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/moving-back-to-berlin/">life update post</a> in 2017 as the latest context. Here is what has happened
since then:</p>

<h2>2018</h2>

<h3>New Home / New Role</h3>

<p><Wilmersdorf home></p>

<p>As the above post mentions, I had moved back to Berlin. Wanting to see a different side of Berlin, I found
a bit of an eclectic apartment in Wilmersdorf. It once was a restaurant and a butcher shop before that. My basement
still had the meat locker storage! I really do miss this place.</p>

<br style="clear:both" />


<p><em>(Liked the office view, large kitchen, summertime office, lounge area above the workstation)</em></p>

<p>I also Joined the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Solutions (PCFS) team and began working 100% remote. This involved a lot of
travel to Milton Keynes for 1 particular customer and to Norway for another. I met a lot of great people and still

<p><em>(Milton Keynes, Oslo, Bergen)</em></p>

<p>I struggled a bit with the travel and reflected that I didn’t move back to Berlin to be on the road a lot. Later in the
year I transferred to the CloudOps team in Pivotal. Ironically, the team was based in Dublin, but I was able to work
100% remote. This was the beginning of a really fun time learning SRE practices and actually applying them. My days with
PCFS and transitioning to CloudOps was in Switzerland at the CloudFoundry Summit in Basel.</p>

<p><em>(Trip to Dublin to onboard with the CloudOps team)</em></p>

<p>Around summer time I decided to purchase a home in Berlin. By the end of the year I had found a place I loved and signed
all the papers. I kept a thorough time journal of the whole process. I’d be up for writing a blog post on this if folks
are interested.</p>

<h2>2019</h2>

<h3>New Home (again) / New Role (again)</h3>

<p>At this point I had been with CloudOps for a couple months and was really enjoying it.</p>

<p>By February I was able to move into my new home. As much as I missed my castle in Wilmersdorf, I loved being closer to
my friends around Prenzlauer Berg and the surrounding area.</p>

<h3>New Companion</h3>

<p>Once I had settled in and got my place organized, I was ready to add a new resident to my flat. A few months later,
I rescued this beautiful 10year old cat named Shelly from the animal shelter. Her previous owner had passed away and
couldn&rsquo;t let her stay in the shelther.</p>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/2021-life-update/shelly1.jpg"><img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/2021-life-update/shelly1-Small.jpg" width="500"></a>

<br style="clear:both" />


<p><em>(Nothing but attitude&hellip; but I still think she enjoys my presence)</em></p>

<p>Since I was enjoying settling down, I didn’t travel very much. However, I still went to Dublin several times to meet
up with the team and my last visit to Vancouver occurred in the Fall.</p>

<p>One of the things that I’m proud of in this year is the talk I did at the CF Summit. The theme around maintenance and
motivation will continue to play out for the next few years. It took almost 20 years to learn that I&rsquo;ve never been
motivated by building &ldquo;the next big thing&rdquo;. Maintaining and improving existing systems is something I&rsquo;ve enjoyed
doing throughout my career.</p>

<h2>2020</h2>

<h3>4 Month Sabbatical</h3>

<p>Now that I’ve feeling settled in Berlin, I wanted to take some time off to savour my new found &ldquo;stability&rdquo;. I figured 4
months would be a good amount of time to tackle some projects and recharge my batteries.</p>

<p>I enrolled in an intensive German class  Unfortunately the intense structure didn’t work well for me. What I did
learn was that I need to apply German in everyday life. Joining some social clubs was my plan (billiards, or something
gaming related). After the course was over the pandemic arrived stopping those plans.</p>

<p>During this break the <a href="https://news.vmware.com/releases/vmware-completes-acquisition-of-pivotal">acquisition of Pivotal by VMware</a> occurred. I learned that the Dublin office that
I used to work at was being closed and some of my friends and colleagues were being let go (my understanding of the
situation was that VMware was very generous and did make space for people that wanted to stay and work remotely in
some capacity).</p>

<p>During my time off and in the midst of the first wave, I took some time to get back into PC gaming and built myself
<a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/b/wX9J7P">my first PC in over 20 years</a>. I tinkered with a bit of game streaming but that didn’t last long because
I was back to work in May.</p>

<h3>Back to Work</h3>

<p>Since the team I was on before my break no longer exists I was put on a new team. We worked on disaster recovery
capabilities for Cloud Foundry running on Kubernetes. It was a great team to land in after my break. I got to work with
some familiar faces and some new faces that I’m happy to still connect with from time to time. Looks like <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/tas-kubernetes/0-7/bandr-restore-manual.html">some of the
things we worked on</a> got released!</p>

<p>However, I did miss running things. It’s one of the things I found really difficult working on product software; you
don’t normally run it yourself. This started in a search for a different team to join to provide a similar experience of
CloudOps. This led to joining the Bitnami SRE team. Bitnami was also acquired by VMware before Pivotal was; but I
suspect due to how small they were, the integration wasn’t done as quickly (e.g.: The Pivotal G Suite was merged before
the Bitnami G Suite). In Bitnami, I was part of their SRE team, which was more like an operations team managing the
infrastructure for all the products and services Bitnami provides.</p>

<p>Shortly after joining <a href="https://bitnami.com/">Bitnami</a>, I caught covid in November.</p>

<h3>Getting Covid</h3>

<p>This was an absolutely horrible experience and writing about my covid experience could be another post. I was lucky that
I didn’t need to be hospitalized but this has been the worst illness I’ve ever experienced (my frequent fights with
strep might have more pain, but they are shorter).</p>

<p>I had a fever for about 4 days. I lost 5kg and was sleeping all the time. I thank <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxx8sEGjntI">Spiritfarer</a> for
getting me through those days. Probably not the best idea to play a “cozy management simulation about death”. Hearing
the soundtrack transports me back to that difficult week.</p>

<p>For the next few months I had chest pain which made it hard to sleep. I got brain fog on a weekly basis that made me
useless for the day. I wouldn’t have the mental capacity to even play a game to pass the time. Thankfully music was
something I could still enjoy.</p>

<p>The worst bit though has been the loss of smell and taste, which still hasn’t recovered to this day (yes, 1 year later).
It’s partially come back but it’s degraded severely. The mental stress of not detecting my own body odour does give me
some social anxiety still. A lot of foods taste drastically different. Wine tastes horrible (like mouthwash), and most
beers are flavourless. Whiskey doesn’t provide that aftertaste that I enjoy so much. My diet is now quite simplistic but
I have built up a mental database of things that still provide some enjoyment (I believe it’s around the umami
sensation).</p>

<p>I was hoping the vaccine would have affected my long-covid symptoms, but it hasn’t changed much.</p>

<p>Something that came about as a result of being ill is that I created a system of connections between a couple of my
friends who I’ve given house keys to, and my family back in Vancouver. As someone who lives alone and isn’t active on
social media, enabling the ability for my family to remotely check in on me seemed prudent. Since the Fall of 2018 I’ve
sent a monthly newsletter to my family and that’s also turned into a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch">Dead Man’s Snitch</a>. I’ve been
consistently sending an email for the last 3 years such that if I missed one, it would be a signal to find out if
something bad has happened to me.</p>

<p>Also&hellip; a big shout out to my neighbor, <a href="https://divyendusingh.com/">Divyendu</a>, who brought me groceries while I was incapable of leaving
the flat.</p>

<h2>2021</h2>

<h3>Leaving VMware</h3>

<p>Now for a tangent on the acquisition experience. An acquisition is a very disrupting experience. One that I’ve never
been through before. I had the intent of continuing with VMware for at least a year to learn from the experience and to
ensure I don’t make any quick decisions based off of an emotional experience in the moment. In the context of the
pandemic, it was also good to have that job stability anyways. It was a roller coaster for me, but in the end I felt
VMware was professional and kind.</p>

<p>After some time I could sense that VMware wasn’t a suitable fit for me. I wasn’t sure what to do, but stuck around
because of my permanent residency application. When I learned that my permanent residency process wasn’t communicated
after the acquisition and I had to start the process from the beginning with a new agency, I became very frustrated and
decided to leave.</p>

<p>The 9 month experience with Bitnami grew my Kubernetes knowledge and experience to a new level. I wish I wrote
publically about the things I worked on. I&rsquo;m proud of some of the videos I created internally to demonstrate how some of
the complex integrations worked.</p>

<h3>Decisions</h3>

<p>When I left VMware, I had the financial security to take a long break, decompress, and re-evaluate the direction I’m
going. Maybe due to long-covid, or just dealing with the pandemic in general, my energy levels weren’t super high, and I
had a hard time doing my day-to-day job and as well as doing a bit of life planning. I figured using my short-term
financial freedom, I could focus on that without work distracting me. Unfortunately, my residency status became my next
urgent issue.</p>

<p>After enjoying a mon  th and half break, it was time to evaluate what my options were. This resulted in a complicated
decision tree (see image) that was made simpler after a 1 hour consultation with an immigration lawyer
(<a href="https://www.legal-links.de/en/anwaeltinnen/juliane-linke/">Juliane Linke is my hero</a>). It became very clear to me after our conversation that getting a job is the
simplest thing for me to do in order to stay in Germany and also not jeopardize my future ability to stay in Germany.</p>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/2021-life-update/decisions.jpg"><img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/2021-life-update/decisions-Small.jpg" width="333"></a></p>

<p>So now I’m currently looking for a job. At this very moment I have 6 applications ongoing with a dozen more in the
queue. I’m so fortunate that there’s so much available in my domain of work. At first the job search was a quest to get
residency, but I found that motivation rather unfullfilling. I was near the point of accepting any job at any
compensation just to end the residential anxiety. After some time and after many chats with friends that I trust dearly,
my perspective broadened and saw my next job as a place to build on my financial security, extend the time for me to
figure out what I desire the most from financial independence, and save up for getting some property in rural Canada.</p>

<p>So that’s where I am now. Looking for a job with a plan to stay in Germany. I don’t have any plans on posting in social
media again, but do miss writing for a broader group of people.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong> The majority of this post was written a few weeks ago. I currently have accepted a job offer! I will be writing
another post about the job search. I haven&rsquo;t had this kind of positive feeling about a new job since I joined Pivotal in
2016 or ThoughtWorks in 2010!</p>

<br style="clear:both" />


<p>Lastly, I wish I could mention all the fabulous people I got to work with with or got to know. There are too many of you
fine people and going through my pictures of the last 4 years reminded me of all of you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Reflections on 2020 and Earlier</h2>

<p>I can&rsquo;t recall exactly why I didn&rsquo;t bother write a goal post (pun?) last year, but let&rsquo;s ignore that for now. I&rsquo;m back
in action! Let&rsquo;s start with some reflections:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Berlin has now been my home for 3 years. This is the longest I&rsquo;ve lived somewhere outside of my home city since
<a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/blog/a-new-beginning-or-goodbye-20-s-hello-30-s/">Calgary</a> (over 11 years ago)! I&rsquo;m loving my home and my life here so I don&rsquo;t see myself moving again
anytime soon. Here&rsquo;s a view of my happy place in my flat (Meine Wohnung).</p>

<p><img src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/2021-happy-place.jpg" width="1000"></p></li>
<li><p>I managed to do start some initiatives related to my <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-resolutions-for-2019/">2019 goal</a> around game streaming!. My videos have
been vieed 377 times and watched for 71hrs. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdY9IPS1jPwLpHwPL3KnLlPi9GpkAKXyP">Soul Level 1 Dark Souls play through</a> is by far my favourite. It&rsquo;s
really a shame I lost episode 1 on Twitch. I learned that doing these streams and videos does take a lot of time and
energy and doing it while working full time is not feasible for me (I did these videos during a couple months break
from work).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/2020-youtube-stats.png" width="500">
<br style="clear:both" /></p></li>
<li>Journal entries: 27 &ndash; I found myself writing in my journal a lot less in 2020. This is not something I want to abandon
this year. Reading my previous entries has been valuable to me. That being said, I&rsquo;ve probably written more words in
2020 than previous years, they just aren&rsquo;t publically accessible. My internal work journal probably has more than 27
entries.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Goals for 2021:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Permanent Residence</strong> &ndash; Given how much I gush about living here, you would think I&rsquo;m a permanent resident? Nope, my
residency here depends on my work permit. I want to break this coupling.</li>
<li><strong>Winding Down Work</strong> &ndash; I&rsquo;m reaching a point where I would prefer to have more time in my life than money. Success
will be reducing my hours somehow (most preferrably working 4 days a week). This is primarily for obligitaory employed
work. I know I&rsquo;ll never stop working :&ndash;)</li>
<li><p><strong>Cycling Initiative</strong> &ndash; I bought a bike this year, and given that all things are pointing to me sticking around
Berlin, I&rsquo;m not as concerned about have to either sell it or transport it. I&rsquo;ve been dealing with all sorts of
different pains in my legs/knees/back ever since I injured myself training for a half marathon in 2015. Riding a bike
has been the best activity for me. Even walking long distances hasn&rsquo;t been good. I want to incorporate bicycling with
how I travel and experience Germany. I have a MASSIVE goal around biking to Luxembourg for a wedding.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/2021-bike.jpg" width="500">
<br style="clear:both" /></p></li>
<li><strong>Launch Personal Finance Site</strong> &ndash; The first two goals wouldn&rsquo;t have seemed feasible to me but the way I&rsquo;ve been
managing my money has opened them up to me. At the moment there&rsquo;s a skeleton of a website for a project that I&rsquo;ve
called <a href="https://www.goodenoughmoney.com/">Good Enough Money</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to shaking things up a bit. My appetite for risk and adventure is back. Funny how in my last update
I mention my travel hunger is satiated. That&rsquo;s certainly turning around now.</p>

    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/valuable-links-git</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why a links post about Git? There are plenty of resources, right? Exactly! There&rsquo;s almost too many resources around Git and you can reach a profiency in Git with just a few.</p>

<p>For fun, check out the results of this search for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/git">git books</a> vs <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/svn">svn books</a>. Hopefully this post will help you to never need to go through that list.</p>

<h2>Some Opinions</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny to me that <code>git</code> is a tool one can become skilled at. When using <code>svn</code> I never felt that I had to learn advanced things (I did own one of those books listed above though). Perhaps it&rsquo;s more a sign of the times and the number of people in software has grown immensely; which is great!.</p>

<p>Start with just the bare bones <code>git</code> CLI. All those helper tools like <a href="https://jonas.github.io/tig/"><code>tig</code></a>, <a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/seeit.html"><code>gitx</code></a>, and IDE integrations will hide what&rsquo;s going on. Knowing how <code>git</code> works comes most handy when you&rsquo;ve done something and you think all your code is lost. Learning through vanilla <code>git</code> commands will go far. Why learn another tools way of doing things when you can just use the underlying <code>git</code> commands?</p>

<p>Ignore the <code>git</code> cheat sheets out there. You&rsquo;ll be able to make your own cheat sheets easily enough. Trust me, once you learn a bit of how the internals work, you&rsquo;ll realise that it&rsquo;s difficult to really screw things up. Source control is, hopefully, something you&rsquo;ll be using every single day. The commands will become muscle memory quickly.</p>

<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll get off my soap box.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out">Git from the inside out</a> &ndash; Mary has written by far the best article I&rsquo;ve read about <code>git</code>. It&rsquo;s long, but if you get to the end with a focused effort, you&rsquo;ll never need to stress about any <code>git</code> command. She even posted a video too!</li>
<li><a href="http://gitready.com">gitready.com</a> &ndash; This site has been around when <code>git</code> first started and has a few good recipes that you should be able to understand well if you&rsquo;ve read the above article. Yeah, there are cheat sheets, but you don&rsquo;t need them now, right?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/presentations/tree/master/git">The Human Git Graph</a> &ndash; A great way to learn is to teach. I created this workshop for those that could use a different angle at understanding <code>git</code>. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun and I would love to know if you try faciliating it yourself.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>What? Just 3 links? Pretty much! The 2nd link has enough resources to keep you busy for days, but I don&rsquo;t believe you need them. You can use that time to grow more important skills.</p>

    <updated>2019-06-10T13:27:50+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/the-day-the-universe-changed-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Background</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Universe_Changed">The Day the Universe Changed</a> is a documentary (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199208/">9.1 on imdb</a>)
from 1985 that covers the effects of science and technology on western
society. I was introduced to the show in grade 8 social studies and I clearly
didn&rsquo;t appreciate the message of the documentary when I was 13-14 years old.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not viewable online. However, this first 10 minutes of the first episode should be enough to get your gears turning.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/REKRLYoz2fc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>In short, it&rsquo;s about trying to understand how do we know what we know and how has it shaped us to be who we are. Funny enough, in the writing of this post I learnt that James Burke has recently gone a bit viral! I really miss James Burke&rsquo;s style.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s 1985. James Burke is walking around in some hills. And then he delivers a scintillating piece to camera about how politics is going to change in the digital age. <br><br>Totally. Crazy.<a href="https://t.co/lX9z5o1p6i">pic.twitter.com/lX9z5o1p6i</a></p>&mdash; Carl Miller (@carljackmiller) <a href="https://twitter.com/carljackmiller/status/1122459930504650752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;ve seen the very beginning and the very end of this 10 episode documentary. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ6XFcrh7IQ">Episode 2</a> is worth watching too if you do not have access to the full series.</p>

<h2>Relevance Today</h2>

<p>I had watched the documentary again recently so it was still fresh on my mind and found myself applying it to a few recent conversations I&rsquo;ve been having.</p>

<p>Two conversations were around folks watching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">Flat Earther</a>
documentary on Netflix. I haven&rsquo;t watched the documentary, but I always thought
considering a model where the Earth is flat is an interesting brain puzzle.
Like the intro linked earlier alludes to, if the Earth was flat, how would that
change what we perceive? If a child asked me to explain why the world is a
sphere (and we know that&rsquo;s not entirely correct either), how can I do that? I
simply take it as fact. I only understand (and could explain) a tiny fraction
of my everyday life and I can still thrive.</p>

<p>After listening to yet another excellent <a href="https://www.econtalk.org">Econtalk</a> podcast episode
about <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/david-epstein-on-mastery-specialization-and-range/">mastery, specialization, and range</a>, I learnt about
how pre-modern people sometimes cannot make logical reasoning based on abstractions. For example, if you say <em>&ldquo;the ground in Yellowknife is frozen
solid most of the year, would it be suitable for farming?&rdquo;</em>, their answer
would be <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve never seen Yellowknife&rdquo;</em>. Despite the clue that
would suggest a reasonable answer of <em>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t imagine a place with frozen
ground growing crops&rdquo;</em>, they base their answers on first hand experience. Yet another reminder to step out of one&rsquo;s own brain to understand how much trust (faith) we put in our abstractions.</p>

<p>Back to the Flat Eather debate. Could one consider this a breakdown in the faith of our abstractions? Or am I leaning too heavily on abstractions and I ought to test things out myself once in a while?</p>

<h2>Religion vs Science?</h2>

<p>I enjoyed how the show didn&rsquo;t pit religion against science. To me it showcased
that they both can have the same goals in mind. Give you what you need in order
to make decisions with your life. It strengthens the statement
<a href="https://www.mbird.com/2008/09/more-david-foster-wallace-quotes/"><em>&ldquo;Everybody worships&rdquo;</em></a> said by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a> in 2005 at the Kenyon College commencement address.</p>

<p>Science is still limited in that it cannot quite decribe the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of so many
things. It&rsquo;s great that we have <a href="https://philosophizethis.org">Philosophize This!</a> to go to when feeling lost.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>

<p>Rewatching this today reminded me that I&rsquo;m much less sure about everything
these days than I was before. But that&rsquo;s a good thing, because I was overly
certain about things before. I feel like I have more gratitude for the everyday mundane things that simply just work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also renergized me about the promise of the Internet and the World Wide Web. In these days of concerns around privacy and questionable platforms, it&rsquo;s good to remember that posting a web page to a system with no centralized
orchestral can be viewed by anyone with an Internet connection (and isn&rsquo;t under a regime that censors the media) is a powerful and amazing thing. Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to dust off the ol&#8217; blog and write up all the thoughts (I refuse to call it content) that I&rsquo;ve been keeping buried for the last couple years.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in Berlin and would like to watch the whole series, let me know. I
may update this post with watching notes next time I go through the series.
Which is something I will be revisiting frequently now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Reflections on <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-resolutions-for-2018/">2018</a></h2>

<p>This will be easy because I didn’t set any goals last year! It felt great to take a break from goal setting
because 2018 was a big year of transition. I <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/moving-back-to-berlin/">moved yet again</a> and I started a new role at work.
I then found that it didn’t fit me and I finally had some self awareness to reach out for help and was able
to switch roles again to something that suits me at this moment in time.</p>

<p>Here are some things I discovered about myself in 2018:</p>

<ul>
<li>Working from home for the first time and I absolutely love it! I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll ever go back to
having a regular commute again.</li>
<li>My travel hunger has been satiated. I will be minimizing my travel until my appetite grows for it again.</li>
<li>Berlin is truly where I want to settle down in the long term. So much so that I’ve bought a home
here and I&rsquo;ve just finished moving in!</li>
<li>I love writing, but sometimes my output doesn&rsquo;t reach the public domain. I&rsquo;ve written more in 2018
than probably any other year.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Goals for 2019:</h2>

<p>As always there are so many things I would like to do. I had a dozen blog post drafts that I ended up purging. I need to work
on my physical health too. Those who know me know that I have some very specific financial goals. To keep things
simple, I&rsquo;m going to stick with one goal and approach it more like a project. For 2019, I would like to end the
year with a published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Play">Let&rsquo;s Play</a> that has at least 50 views of the final
video in the series. This ought to be a good test on whether or not game recordings is something worth pursuing.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve sneakily already started on my goal with a completed series of Civilization VI! So far it&rsquo;s only been shared
with a private group of friends.</p>

<p>By-the-way, journaling (<a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-resolutions-for-2016/">goal from 2016</a>) has been the one habit that I’ve cultivated
and has lasted several years! Here are the numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Perform 1 pull up</strong> &ndash; This didn&rsquo;t go so well. I&rsquo;m now the heaviest that I&rsquo;ve ever been (95kg). My psoriasis (scalp) has become really annoying and gets worse when I exercise. So 2017 wasn&rsquo;t a good year for my health. It&rsquo;s very clear that I don&rsquo;t handle disruption of my routine very well. Below is a graph of my workouts:</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/workouts-2017.png" width="1024"></p>

<p>Only 1 or 2 of those gaps was related to illness; most of them were due to travel (work and play). The last few months was me being preoccupied with my move to Berlin (yet another excuse).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>journaling</strong> &ndash; I also took a look at if I adhered to my <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-resolutions-for-2016/">2016</a> goal to maintain a journal. The following graph shows that I started the year off strong and then it faded away for a bit.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/journal-entries-2017.png" width="1024"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking back in my journal periodically now and finding it a great source of insight into what my previous self was thinking. I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;ve started picking it up last month.</p>

<h2>Goal for 2018:</h2>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@catehstn/the-2018liberation-list-4e229bdbb919">Cate Huston</a>, I&rsquo;m going to liberate myself from making a goal for this year. I&rsquo;ve just moved back to Berlin and will spend this year settling in and exploring.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not going to doing anything about my personal health, I just am not deciding what it is at this current moment.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>2018 is going to be a year of settling down and some reflection. I&rsquo;m happy to have found a home where I&rsquo;m excited by the prospect of being there for many years. I&rsquo;m just going to let that feeling spawn iniatives as the year goes on.</p>

    <link href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/moving-back-to-berlin/"/>
    <updated>2017-12-09T15:25:18+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/moving-back-to-berlin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/berlin-walk.jpg" width="1024"></p>

<p>Remember that <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/joining-pivotal-cloud-foundry-and-moving-to-dublin/">post about moving to Dublin</a> from almost a couple years ago? Consider this a tiny <code>git revert --no-commit</code> of that, modify it slightly to keep my location as Berlin but Pivotal as my employer.</p>

<h2>A Pivotal Moment (that has lasted 2 years)</h2>

<p>The whole process started with a strong desire to move back to Berlin (I&rsquo;ll go into why later). I was willing to look for a different job but I really really didn&rsquo;t want to. Pivotal has been fantastic and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it there. Since I joined I&rsquo;ve worked on 3 different teams over 2 years:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager">Ops Manager</a></strong> &ndash; A web platform for managing all the products offered on the <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Network</a> (think of this as an AppStore for Ops Manager)</li>
<li><strong>Release Engineering</strong> &ndash; A team responsible for packaging all the components of <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/">Cloud Foundry</a> in a <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime">package</a> that can install in <strong>Ops Manager</strong>. Now they support even more products and the automation to sustain it all is really impressive!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-rabbitmq">RabbitMQ for PCF</a></strong> &ndash; This is where I spent the bulk of my time (18 months). For part of the time I played software developer and for the majority of the time I played product manager. Both roles had a myriad of activities that cover the many facets of software delivery so I enjoyed this time very much.</li>
</ul>


<p>In all of these projects I got to work with great people who challenged me and allowed me to challenge them as well. The products themselves are also quite interesting and are gaining a lot of traction in the market. Cloud Foundry is something I would have enjoyed using if my primary activity was writing application code.</p>

<p>So, when I mentioned my desire to move to my manager, <a href="https://twitter.com/jamiemonserrate">Jamie Monseratte</a>,  he responded with support and positivity. I was able to explore the different things I could do in Berlin and eventually landed on a role called <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/pivotalsoftware/jobs/877047#.WiwIP7Q-fdQ">Platform Reliability Engineer</a> (we&rsquo;re hiring). It feels like it&rsquo;ll be a fun mix of enablement, hands on operations, and customer engagement. I&rsquo;ve learned that I love running software more than the building software so this appears to be a great fit for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a few days in the office and met everyone at the Christmas party (photo to be added soon). I already feel welcome!</p>

<h2>Dublin</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/dublin-spree.jpg" width="1024"></p>

<p>Living in Dublin was a great experience. I&rsquo;ve learned all about <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/irish-whiskey-appreciation/">irish whiskey</a> which is now my favourite spirit. I&rsquo;ve made some friends and have visited more pubs than I can possible count. I&rsquo;m going to miss all the concert venues which became my home away from home.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s The Deal With Berlin?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to explain why exactly I wanted to be back in Berlin. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever moved back to a city. The best way I can describe how I felt is that Berlin has the most gravity. Every location has a bit of gravity: Vancouver, San Francisco, Bangalore; But Berlin had sufficient gravity to pull me out of Dublin. You know a place is right when people describe the things they dislike about a city and you find those are the reasons why you like it.</p>

<p>In my head this is the last move I&rsquo;m going to be doing voluntarily. I wish to settle down in Berlin and make it the first place I&rsquo;ve lived in for longer than 2 years since I lived in Vancouver (which implies I haven&rsquo;t lived in the same city for longer than 18 months in the last 8 years).</p>

<p>In my first week in Berlin I&rsquo;ve found my new home. It&rsquo;s an interesting flat in Wilmersdorf. It&rsquo;s large, has lots of character, and is well connected to all of Berlin. I look forward to having you over :&ndash;)</p>

    <link href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/valuable-links-tls/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-06T21:40:48+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/valuable-links-tls</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is embarassing to admit but I have to re-learn Transport Layer Security (TLS) on a continuous basis. This post
is my cheatsheet to remembering all the itty bitty details, which I&rsquo;ll forgot shortly after I do whatever TLS related
task I have on my plate.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s TLS you ask? Take 9 minutes to listen to this fantastic episode on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04vqrwy">Public key cryptography</a>
which will prime (hah!) you up for the rest of the post.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s The Difference Between SSL And TLS?</h2>

<p>The fact that I still think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL</a> over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> is likely a result of my first exposure to dealing with
these sorts of things was in a multi-tenant Windows web hosting environment. I seriously can&rsquo;t believe I was able to do
the things I did back then without having one iota of understanding what was going on.</p>

<p>I only learned that the difference between <em>SSL</em> and <em>TLS</em> is so simple just a couple years ago. It boils down to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you expecting a secure connection because the port you&rsquo;re connecting to is by definition intended to be a secure
port? Then we&rsquo;re talking about <strong>SSL</strong>.</li>
<li>Do you start connecting and switch to a secure mode based on the feedback coming back over the &ldquo;wire&rdquo;? Then we&rsquo;re
talking about <strong>TLS</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Yup, it&rsquo;s as simple as that. Big thanks to the <a href="https://luxsci.com/blog/ssl-versus-tls-whats-the-difference.html">SSL vs TLS &ndash; What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a> post for helping
me finally understand this!</p>

<h2>What Are Certificates?</h2>

<p>When it comes to certifcates, I&rsquo;ve yet to find a resource that does a good high level explanation. For the time being
I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://blog.talpor.com/2015/07/ssltls-certificates-beginners-tutorial/">SSL/TLS Certificates Beginners&#8217; Tutorial</a> the best resource because it does explain the <code>openssl</code>
command in a bit of detail and links to even more resources. Having a basic grasp of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Certificate Authorities</a>,
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_trust">chain of trust</a> (not a 90&rsquo;s Christian metal band) is another piece
of the puzzle to understand well because it&rsquo;s where things can often go wrong and result in cryptic errors
(like the browser warnings that we all ignore).</p>

<p>My simplified understanding is that a certificate certifies hat the one (machine) with the certificate is the entity
that the certificate says it&rsquo;s certifying. I believe this is true for server and client certificates, but I am not 100% sure.</p>

<h2>What Goes On When You Use HTTPS?</h2>

<p>Nearly everytime I need to setup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> I find that I need to reread the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">First Few Milliseconds of an HTTPS Connection</a> article. It&rsquo;s a long read but if you spend a day following
the links and focusing on understanding that article, you&rsquo;ll tackle any <em>HTTPS</em> related task with ease. You&rsquo;ll just
forget it all after a few days.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.robinhowlett.com/blog/2016/01/05/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-ssl-but-were-afraid-to-ask/">Everything You Ever Wanted to Know SSL&hellip;</a> is another great post that dives deep into the low level of
what happens in creating a secure connection.</p>

<h2>Hostname Verification</h2>

<p><a href="%22https://twitter.com/will_sargent%22">Will Sargent</a> wrote an excellent series on <a href="https://tersesystems.com/blog/2014/03/31/testing-hostname-verification/">Testing Hostname Verification</a>
which goes into the guts of many of the parts discussed in this post.</p>

<h2>How Do Things Go Wrong?</h2>

<p>The following video by <a href="https://moxie.org/">Moxie Marlinspike</a> is told at a nice slow pace on how certificates can break down.
It&rsquo;s a good reminder to be humble when dealing with these complex security tools. I tend to rewatch this video after
reading the above articles. If I can follow the video, then I&rsquo;ve chunked enough knowledge to move on.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ibF36Yyeehw " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Hope these help. It&rsquo;s inspired by all the other folks that also couldn&rsquo;t tell me the difference between SSL and TLS.
It&rsquo;s easy to feel ashamed about not knowing these technologies, security is a very hard domain. I&rsquo;ve kept my
explanations to a minimum because I don&rsquo;t feel confident I can provide correct information, nor am I able to explain it
simply. When in doubt, I&rsquo;ll look to the resources here. Hopefully this will give you a good starting ground if you&rsquo;ve
been asked to do anything related to <strong>SSL/TLS</strong> and <strong>certificates</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> I was contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/BlastYourBlog">Matt Banner</a> who asked me to update this article with some content from his
website. I took a look at it and it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.onblastblog.com/http-to-https/">really good guide</a> for updating from <code>http</code> to <code>https</code> (pop quiz, is
this SSL or TLS?) plus it has a really good infographic.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong> Found a couple more excellent resources on the subject. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzz3bcnWf7M">A Tour of TLS</a> is probably the clearest
video I&rsquo;ve watched on the subject. It clarified some of the more obscure pieces of the protocol like OCSP and Stapling
in such a way that I finally got it! <a href="https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki.html">Everything PKI</a> brings pretty much of what&rsquo;s in the Tour of
TLS video in the frame of a system operator (e.g.: through <code>openssl</code> commands).</p>

    <link href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/irish-whiskey-appreciation/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-20T19:05:47+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/irish-whiskey-appreciation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/dublin.jpg" width="1024"></p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer &ndash; I was not paid or propositioned to write this post and/or link to the Mitchell &amp; Son web store. I just
enjoyed their course a lot. At the end of the course I was given a 10€ discount on any Green/Yellow spot whiskies. I
would also recommend the <a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/">Celtic Whiskey Shop</a> too.</strong></p>

<p>Over the last month I had the wonderful opportunity of learning all about Irish whiskey. It was held in the
<a href="http://mitchellandson.com/">Mitchell and Son</a> store in <a href="http://chq.ie/">The CHQ Building</a> (where I work) so how could I not participate?
If you see them offering it again I highly recommend it! Not only did I learn a lot about Irish whiskey, I learned
a lot about whiskey in general.</p>

<p>First, a bit of history. It&rsquo;s quite possible that you are screaming at your screen shouting that I am spelling
whiskey incorrectly. Chill out. The word originates from the old Irish word <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uisce_beatha">uisce</a></em> (meaning water). When
Scotch whisky became popular the proud Irish introduced &lsquo;e&rsquo; into the anglicised version of <em>uisce</em>, hence whiskey.
The USA often uses this spelling too which may be because of the large amounts of Irish emigration during that time.
What&rsquo;s very clear is that people do spend way too much time arguing about what is the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way. The liquid doesn&rsquo;t
care what you call it.</p>

<p>Three of the evenings had brand ambassadors to do a bit of a sales pitch. At least that&rsquo;s what I thought they were going
to do. What I ended up hearing from them was passion about whiskey and its Irish origins. They enjoyed their competitors
products and they were happy to be a part of the booming Irish whiskey resurgence. There was a feeling of
disappointment  about the world view of Irish whiskey. Scotch is perceived as the ultimate whiskey and that Irish whiskey
is only used for shots (and usually only Jameson).</p>

<p>Thankfully, I know better now. The course made me appreciate Irish whiskey, but it made me appreciate the Irish people
as well. The course did not have any air of snobbery about it. The presenters gave tips and hints about how they like to
enjoy their whiskey but didn&rsquo;t seem to be too bothered too much if people had other ways of enjoying it. In the end they
just wanted people to know that Irish whiskey isn&rsquo;t just shots of Jameson and a brutal hangover.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s begin!</p>

<h2>Week 1 &ndash; Single Pot Still Whiskey</h2>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week1-whiskies-full.jpg"><img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week1-whiskies.jpg" width="400"></a>
Irish single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_still">pot still</a> whiskey is the traditional way of making the spirit. It&rsquo;s a bit more laborious
compared to using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_still">continuous still (aka column still)</a>, which some whiskeys in later weeks are made by.</p>

<p>For traditional Irish single pot still whiskey the mash bill is half malted barley and half unmalted barley. The unmalted
barley is there because of tax laws the existed in 1795. This tickles the economist in me because I love seeing how
financial incentives create innovation (the history of British ales and Belgium beer have similar economic origins). With
the tax incentives gone this style of whiskey is still made because the flavour profile became rather popular.</p>

<p>The distilling begins with a fermenting mash heated to a temperature where the alcohol evaporates. The first
distillation isn&rsquo;t pure enough so this gets distilled again. When you read a label that says &ldquo;triple distilled&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s
because it was distilled in pot stills and you need that third distillation to really extract the cleanest
distilate. Some whiskeys are known and enjoyed for being double distilled, but this usually isn&rsquo;t by design. It&rsquo;s
most likely because of budget since the extra still does cost quite a bit (again with the financial incentives).</p>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week1-notes-full.jpg"><img class="right" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week1-notes.jpg" width="500"></a>
The evening started with a collection of whiskies in a circle. In the period of 2 hours we heard the wise words
of Mark McLaughlin. You can instantly tell the guy is mad about whiskey. He does an excellent job of getting you just
as excited to experience the whiskey as he is.</p>

<p>To the right you can see the whiskeys I tried.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://mitchellandson.com/spirits/spirits-category/whiskey/green-spot-chateau-leoville-barton.html">Green Spot Château Léoville Barton</a> &ndash; A very unique nose (how it smells) on this one. My notes
say hopscotch but after further tastings I would add cookie dough or frosting. On the palate (how it tastes) is a bit
like buttered toast but transforms into a cinnamon toast. There&rsquo;s some nuts and spice to it as well. The finish
(aftertaste) is fruity, warm, and medium length.</li>
<li><a href="http://mitchellandson.com/redbreast-sherry-finish-lustau-edition.html">Red Breat Lustau</a> &ndash; Like the above it had a buttery nose to it. On the palate it was much meatier
and savory. There&rsquo;s dried fruit and a bit of spice. This is one of the remaining bottles I feel I need to add to the
collection.</li>
<li>I have to mention the <a href="http://mitchellandson.com/spirits/spirits-category/green-yellow-spot/green-spot-whiskey-10-year-old.html">Green Spot 10 Year Old</a> and the <a href="http://mitchellandson.com/spirits/spirits-category/midleton-dair-ghaelach-irish-oak-tree-3.html">Middleton Dair Ghaelach</a>
because they were amazing, but way out of my price range. I&rsquo;m quite content with the mid priced gems above.</li>
</ol>


<p>The representitive for this week was from <a href="http://www.irishdistillers.ie/">Irish Distillers</a> and boy could he talk&hellip; and talk&hellip; and talk.</p>

<br style="clear: both;" />


<h2>Week 2 &ndash; Single Malt Whiskey</h2>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week2-whiskies-full.jpg"><img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week2-whiskies.jpg" width="400"></a>
The theme for this week is single malt whiskey. The term &ldquo;single malt&rdquo; has become synonymous with high quality. You may
even hear people say that they like a nice &ldquo;single malt&rdquo; and not mention the word whiskey. That&rsquo;s how popular and recognized
the term has become.</p>

<p>Some individuals think this is the only real style of whiskey and frown upon anything that&rsquo;s blended. They forget that
the word &ldquo;single&rdquo; implies that the liquid is just coming from the same distillery. The &ldquo;malt&rdquo; part means that only malted
barley is in the mash bill (you&rsquo;ll recall single pot still also had unmalted barley). Blending 100% malt whiskey of
different ages is very common. Again it&rsquo;s a matter of economics as well as taste. Because the business has fairly long
feedback loops their finance departments often face liquidity (zing) issues. So when you get a bottle and it says 8
years on the label, that&rsquo;s just the age of the youngest liquid in the bottle. Master blenders will use their stock to
combine different casks of several ages and come up with flavours that can be great and ready for the shelf.</p>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week2-notes-full.jpg"><img class="right" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week2-notes.jpg" width="500"></a>
The brand ambassador of the evening was from <a href="http://www.bushmills.com/">Bushmills</a> which is the only old time distillery still in operation on the
island of Ireland (circa 1784). I really need to get myself up to Belfast for a visit and then a distillery tour up in
Bushmills at some point.</p>

<p>To the right you can see the whiskeys I tried.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Bushmills Port Cask</em> &ndash; Something about this one tasted familiar. I believe I had a port cask Lagavulin that was like a
warm cozy blanket. This one was like that.</li>
<li><a href="http://mitchellandson.com/spirits/spirits-category/whiskey/teeling-revival-volume-ii-13-year-old.html">Teeling Revival Volume II</a> &ndash; My notes show a dominate apple characteristic. The nose was like
freshly cut green apple. The palate was like experiencing a 3 course meal! First was a light salad with fresh cut
apples, then something savoury like a vegetable stew, then finishes up with apple pie. I don&rsquo;t know if the first
whiskies had an affect on me, but I need to get a bottle of this to see if I can replicate that experience.</li>
<li><em>Tullamore Dew 18yr</em> &ndash; Again I got lots of apple, but that could have been the residue from the previous whiskey. The
palate was all over the place with juniper, mint, raisin, and honey. I even got a feeling of masala chai out of it.
This was very nice whiskey.</li>
</ol>


<p>You may have noticed an absence of links in a couple of the above whiskies. It turns out that airport duty free stores
are a huge market and many brands create airport only whiskies. The Bushmills representive said that 50% of their
product turnover is in airports! Such a shame because these two were really really good.</p>

<h2>Week 3 &ndash; All Grain and Independent Bottlers</h2>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week3-whiskies-full.jpg"><img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week3-whiskies.jpg" width="400"></a>
The first couple whiskeys of the evening was a brief tour of Single Grain whiskey. The best I can understand it is that
the distillate is made of corn and distilled by column stills. This makes them a bit cheaper to produce and have their
own flavour profiles. They are much lighter on the palate and easy to drink. While I thought they were quite drinkable,
they didn&rsquo;t have the bigger flavour that I prefer.</p>

<p>Independent bottlers are a collection of brands that aren&rsquo;t backed by the big players in the market. What I found very
interesting is that the brand of the whiskey doesn&rsquo;t imply that they distilled the liquid. Since Ireland only has a handful
of running distilleries the liquid would only come from them (usually Bushmills but others are upping their production).
The independents can then choose their casks and blending strategies to make something unique and distinctly theirs. I&rsquo;m
glad they did because they produced a couple of my favourites!</p>

To the right you can see the whiskeys I tried.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://mitchellandson.com/writer-s-tears-red-head.html">Writer&rsquo;s Tears Red Head</a> &ndash; This is probably the best value out of all the whiskies that I rated
highly. The finish just keeps going. The middle provides this mouth feel that is a joy for the tongue.</li>
<li><a href="http://mitchellandson.com/spirits/dunville-s-10yo-px-finish.html">Dunvilles PX Cask Finish</a> &ndash; The nose is full of pineapple and tropical fruit. There&rsquo;s a bit of
chocolate there too. When you taste it you get something like a spicy valentines day heart candy, which settles down
into a nutty soft middle. The finish is smooth and long with hints of black berries and pine. Every sip of this is a
new story and trying to explain the flavours is so much fun. This is by far my favourite whiskey of the entire
course.</li>
<li><a href="http://mitchellandson.com/spirits/connemara-22-year-old.html">Connemara 22 yrs</a> &ndash; Another really complex whiskey with the flavour going all over the map. It was
very peaty, but behind the smokiness was many other flavours hiding in the woodwork (zing!). At the price
point it&rsquo;ll be something I pick up for a special occasion. Nah, I&rsquo;ll probably get a bottle soon enough.</li>
</ol>


<p>The first two were so good that I bought both of them the next day.</p>

<h2>Week 4 &ndash; Blended Whiskey</h2>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week4-whiskies-full.jpg"><img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week4-whiskies.jpg" width="400"></a>
In the single malt section I described a bit of what blending entails. It&rsquo;s pretty simple to describe, but the execution
of the tasty blend is where the skills comes in. Blends are also quite fun to drink because it provides a puzzle for the
drinker to disect and figure out the blend composition is made up of. I felt that I was a bit snobby regarding blended
whiskies but I&rsquo;m ready to give blends much more time than before. It&rsquo;s funny how fickle our opinions can be when it
comes to taste. If it doesn&rsquo;t taste like what you&rsquo;re used to it seems natural to dislike it. Shake out those
preconceived biases and enjoy the drink on its own. Easier said than done.</p>

<p>The final week was extra special because the tastings were done blind. I loved this because it makes biased opinions
a lot harder. I would like to taste more whiskies this way. Something to keep in mind is that every single whiskey is very
good. None would be something I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to finish a bottle of. My scores just help me decide which of these
fine whiskies I should spend my money on.</p>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week4-notes-full.jpg"><img class="right" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/whiskey/week4-notes.jpg" width="500"></a>
To the right you can see the whiskeys I tried.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://mitchellandson.com/tullamore-dew-12-year-old.html">Tullamore Dew 12yr</a> &ndash; This one was a lot of fun to drink. It&rsquo;s a triple style blend (single
pot-still, malt, and grain). I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the blending but I enjoyed the juxtaposition of the nose
compared to the palate. It plays with the tongue in a prickly way too. At less than 50€ it&rsquo;s a pretty decent value
too.</li>
<li><a href="http://mitchellandson.com/the-irishman-cask-strength.html">Irishman Cask Strength</a> &ndash; A bit pricey but it provides so many ways to enjoy it. Every sip was
different. Adding a few drops of water took the edge off and created a brand new whiskey. Reading my notes seems to
reflect that because they didn&rsquo;t even make any sense! They were all over the place.</li>
</ol>


<p>The representitive for this week was from <a href="https://www.tullamoredew.com/">Tullamore Dew</a>. I enjoyed his easy going nature and his more
laissez faire attitude about how to drink whiskey. Seemed like someone that would be fun to go out for drinks with.</p>

<br style="clear: both;" />


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The course was well worth the 160€. Now I&rsquo;m happily building up a small collection of my favourites. Because of this
course I feel that I am getting much better value for the money spent because I am purchasing the whiskeys that best
fit what I enjoy. I wouldn&rsquo;t complain about any of the whiskies I tried, but when it comes to spending your hard earned
cash, it&rsquo;s nice to know a bit about what you&rsquo;re getting. Now I just need to add the <a href="http://mitchellandson.com/redbreast-sherry-finish-lustau-edition.html">Red Breast Lustau</a>,
<a href="http://mitchellandson.com/tullamore-dew-12-year-old.html">Tullamore Dew 12</a> and the <a href="http://mitchellandson.com/spirits/spirits-category/whiskey/teeling-revival-volume-ii-13-year-old.html">Teeling Revival Volume II</a> and I&rsquo;ll have a collection
fit for any occasion. Ok, I still need something peaty like a Connemara too.</p>

<p><strong>Sláinte!</strong></p>

    <link href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/osx-workstation-setup-automation/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-11T14:45:48+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/osx-workstation-setup-automation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>DISCLAIMER Try out at your own risk. This setup is not meant to be copy+paste reusable. It&rsquo;s about keeping MY
workstation under source control, and this strategy may destroy the machine you wish to attempt this on.</strong></span></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>IT infrastructure has gone down a long journey of automating all of the things. We have automated deployments, production
environments, and regression testing. We can make an API request to Amazon and get a server instances in minutes. The
developer workstation is another story. Often, the developer workstation is a finely crafted machine. Just like
production, your workstation should be treated like a <a href="https://twitter.com/pcalcado/status/759218156493795329">hotel room</a> rather than an owned residence.</p>

<h2>My Setup</h2>

<p>Why bother with this for my personal machine? It serves as a good disaster recovery method. Using this automation for
the last several years (several laptops + multiple laptop repaves) has given me a lot of confidence that I know what
is required to get my machine ready.</p>

<p>There are plenty of <a href="#existing-tools">tools</a> that help with this process. What I am going to describe is yet another
approach, but I hope the simplicity of it will be attractive to those who have struggled trying to get other frameworks
to work.</p>

<p>To see what&rsquo;s included in this tooling take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/osx-homedir#so-whats-included">Inventory</a>. Essentially you get shell configuration, some OSX tweaks, and a bunch of software installed.</p>

<h2>There&rsquo;s No Place Like Home</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/osx-homedir/">My workstation automation</a> is cloned straight into <code>$HOME</code> on a fresh machine. This is a bit different than a lot of the other <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=dotfiles">dotfile repositories</a> you&rsquo;ll see on GitHub.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/gh-dotfiles.png"></p>

<p><code>$HOME</code> as a repository was heavily influenced by <a href="https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles">Gary Bernhardt&rsquo;s dot files</a>. I really liked the simplicity of not having extra scripting to create a bunch of symlinks. Once you have your home directory cloned, you&rsquo;re already quite far down the path of having your machine the way you want it. Because it&rsquo;s a repository, when you delete a file, it goes away and rerunning your setup will not restore that file. It&rsquo;s inherently an idempotent system!</p>

<p>Another feature I like about Gary&rsquo;s setup is that uses <code>~/bin</code> scripts rather than liberal use of aliases in his shell profile. This way you really minimize the configuration of your shell. I personally dislike shell plugin frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it">bash-it</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> as I believe they add complexity where it really isn&rsquo;t warranted. Keep things simple and you don&rsquo;t need frameworks to manage stuff.</p>

<p>That being said, not using a framework is accepting the trade-off of not getting the benefit of community updates. I personally like watching the community for inspiration, not for automatically ingesting their updates.</p>

<h2>Awkward OSX Settings</h2>

<p>My previous iteration of this automation was 100% <a href="https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap">pivotal-sprout</a> based. If you look <a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/osx-homedir/blob/9e9c6bee3e24b481c06ba0cfaffdb0e3b6ac93ff/bin/coalesce_this_machine#L14-L21">closely</a> you will see that this
automation still invokes sprout. I&rsquo;ve gone the route of using it as a collection of OSX configurations. I could maintain some of these as shell scripts, but I feel ok having this additional complexity and added dependency.</p>

<p>The configuration provided by sprout is listed in the <a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/osx-homedir#so-whats-included">Inventory</a>.</p>

<h2>What Could Possibly Go Wrong</h2>

<p>Workstation automation can be extremely flaky and that&rsquo;s due to the nature of it fetching dependencies from all sorts of locations. This drives home the reason for needing to run it frequently. I can pretty much guarantee that the code that worked a month ago will not work today. Packages change name, or download locations change. This can result in a lot of mistrust of the automation.</p>

<p>Having a good routine of wiping your machine and setting up from scratch is a good way to ensure it all still works. I used to be the type that was proud of how long they could keep their workstation running and would do OS upgrades (Windows, OSX, and FreeBSD). Now I feel much more satisfied by destroying and recreating.</p>

<h2>Duplication is OK</h2>

<p>Choosing when to vendor something is an important decision to make around construction your setup. The more you vendor,
the more reproducible your automation will be. The more you vendor, the harder it is to keep up to date with changes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bkuhlmann/osx#os-x-el-capitan">OSX installer</a> steps is something I&rsquo;d be willing to copy and paste into my own repository. Vendoring <code>vim</code> plugins is something I&rsquo;m in favour of doing as well. The principle is that the fewer moving parts there are, the better. Even with what I believe to be a simple workstation setup, there&rsquo;s still many external facing pieces that will cause failure or tricky bugs to appear.</p>

<p>There does not exist one true workstation to rule them all. Neither is there one workstation automation method to rule them all. Your automation is going to be a somewhat handcrafted piece of art, but it&rsquo;s going to be a simple piece
of art (hopefully).</p>

<h2>Replicating This Strategy</h2>

<p>Attempting this kind of automation seems to be best grown and not copied. If you&rsquo;re starting from scratch, the first step is running <code>git init</code> in your <code>$HOME</code> dir, adding 1 precious dot file, and pushing that somewhere off your machine.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In the end, I have a setup I&rsquo;m relatively happy with. It turns out that my implementation looks oddly similar to <a href="https://github.com/gerhard/setup">Gerhard&rsquo;s</a>, a colleague of mine.</p>

<p>This post still took way too long to write making me think that I haven&rsquo;t made it simple enough though. There&rsquo;s still a lot of moving parts and many concepts I didn&rsquo;t dive into at all (e.g.: what about my data).</p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><span id="existing-tools"><strong>Other Tools and Strategies</strong></span></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap">Sprout</a> &ndash; Intially this was called <code>pivotal_workstation</code> but transformed into a slightly more
configurable and modular system. It uses <code>chef</code> under the covers and is quite comprehensive.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/boxen/boxen">Boxen</a> &ndash; Created by GitHub, this tool uses <code>puppet</code> under the covers.</li>
<li><a href="https://osxc.github.io/">osxc</a> &ndash; Not sure where it was born from, but it uses <code>ansible</code> underneath.</li>
</ul>


<p> All three of these strive for the same thing, but use different engines. It probably makes sense to use whichever one
 uses the Configuration Management tool you&rsquo;re most comfortable with. The problem though, is that these tools may add a
 bit more complexity than is really necessary.</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.ifdown.net/">Sam Gibson</a> wrote a <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/p2magazine/issue08/babushka/">great article</a> about this using <a href="https://babushka.me/">Babushka</a>. He believed the
 above styles are too complex and strived to find a simpler solution. I like it, but I felt that it could be
 simplified further.</p>

<p> <a href="https://github.com/gerhard/setup">Gerhard Lazu&rsquo;s</a> workstation setup. He replaced <strong>sprout</strong> with a collection to
 shell scripts that I may be tempted to migrate towards. But one thing at a time; that&rsquo;s an important principle around
 working on this kind of stuff. There are a lot of moving parts and it&rsquo;ll only prove itself out over time.</p>

<p> <a href="http://joeyh.name/svnhome/">Joey Hess</a> has been doing this since 2000 using CVS (then SVN, then git).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSH keys</strong></p>

<p> You are probably going to want to update your code. In order to be able to push your changes to GitHub you&rsquo;ll need to
have your keys. For this, I follow Tammer Saleh&rsquo;s excellent post on <a href="http://tammersaleh.com/posts/building-an-encrypted-usb-drive-for-your-ssh-keys-in-os-x/">building an encrypted usb drive for your keys</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Baseline OS</strong></p>

<p> Technically you cannot start from scratch because you need at least an existing OSX machine to create the installer USB
stick. To do this, I followed the instructions on Brooke Kuhlmann&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/bkuhlmann/osx#os-x-el-capitan">workstation automation</a>*
repository.</p>

<p>When following this process, I reformat the machines disk with an encrypted volume and always create my new machine with
a different username (to ensure my automation doesn&rsquo;t make too many assumptions on pathes).</p>

<p>I wrote <strong>143</strong> journal entries over the course of 2016.  After counting them all up there are far fewer than I thought,
but the frequency is actually more consistent than I thought. I had imagined I had more months that only had a couple
entries. I see this as my first step in writing more and hopefully bringing it to this website. Seeing that my
journalling actually increased by the end of the year makes me really happy. I&rsquo;m going to continue this in 2017 for
sure.</p>

<h2>Goal for 2017:</h2>

<p>In the spirit of keeping my goal(s) simple and achievable I&rsquo;m going to stick to a similar strategy as 2016.</p>

<h3>Perform 1 Perfect Pullup</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s been many years since I&rsquo;ve been able to do a pullup. My body finally feels recovered from my previous injuries, but
it&rsquo;s certainly weaker than it&rsquo;s ever been. My <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/health/">health dashboard</a> has already helped me reach a gym
going habit, but now I need to direct this routine to a different end. I cannot do the physical things I used to because
I&rsquo;ve gotten so out of shape and my previous focus on running put too much pressure on my weak body.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>As I grow older, the length of a year seems much shorter. I wonder if my previous <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/blog/categories/yearly-goals/">goals</a> were a result of not
acknowledging how much I can possibly do in that time frame.</p>

    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/dealing-with-contempt-culture-in-the-software-world</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago I <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/leaving-a-dream-job-and-going-on-an-adventure/">left ThoughtWorks</a> and was considering leaving IT altogether.</p>

<blockquote><p>Though I’m listing things related to ThoughtWorks, a lot of my weariness is more<br/>from IT in general. It could be an age thing, but I’ve been around long enough to<br/>see a lot of terrible things going on in this industry. No one seems to care about<br/>security, and the innovation that is making billions in the stock market are consumer<br/>products that mean almost nothing to me. It’s hard to be optimistic after Edward<br/>Snowden revealed the NSA privacy issues.</p><footer><strong>Me</strong> <cite><a href='http://scottmuc.com/leaving-a-dream-job-and-going-on-an-adventure/'>Leaving a Dream Job and Going on an Adventure</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>After a long break and working at a couple more companies I am able to pinpoint some specific behaviours
of individuals that have an affect on my work ethic and general work happiness.</p>

<h2>Contempt Culture (in software)</h2>

<p>Recently I read an excellent post about <a href="http://blog.aurynn.com/contempt-culture">Contempt Culture</a>. What resonated so much with me was that I
remember being that way when I first started my career. I was impressionable and looked up to the veterans that I met at
conferences that appeared to me as people that knew everything. They&rsquo;ve seen it all. They would speak with such
authority on all the things and I bought it all. I didn&rsquo;t question, nor probe for reasons.</p>

<p>Nowadays I feel like my attitude is much better (friends, please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong), but I still have a lot of room
for improvement. But&hellip; I&rsquo;m now one of those so called veterans I looked up to. I can see how much BS they were spouting
and how overconfident they were. I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m a bad developer, in fact I think I have a fairly strong skillset, but
I definitely don&rsquo;t know as much as I perceived those veterans to know.</p>

<p>Reading the quote from my previous blog post reveals the contempt that I was feeling. Do I still feel the same?
Sort of, but my energy is more focused on delivering value. It feels like a weight off my shoulders.</p>

<p>Part of me feels that <a href="http://bikeshed.com/">bike shedding</a> and the <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/05/narcissism-of-small-code-differences.html">narcissism of small (code) differences</a>
are linked in some way. I don&rsquo;t have any evidence whatsoever, just something to ponder. It&rsquo;s easier to mock something
that differs in a trivial way. Anecdotally, I&rsquo;ve heard more criticism fired at Python because of the significance of
whitespace more than any other parts of the language.</p>

<p>Please watch this discussion titled <a href="https://vimeo.com/3536799">Why So Mean</a> from the Alt.NET Seattle 2009 open space
conversation. It does show many of the different personalities and perspectives.</p>

<h2>How it Affects Me (and how I deal with it)</h2>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve learnt is that this attitude can suck the energy out of me. When I meet an individual that exhibits these
behaviours I then have contempt for them! This is just as toxic and I&rsquo;m struggling to deal with it. I rarely engage
with these people because of the energy it takes out of me. Here are some thoughts that come to my head when I
hear dismissive comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>My friend made that! I saw what was there before and they have improved it so much!</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s so easy why don&rsquo;t you do it?</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re wasting energy, can we focus on the problem in front of us?</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re too stupid to understand the complexity of the problem they are trying to solve.</li>
<li>If everyone did things the way you think they ought to be done, you think the world would be better?</li>
</ul>


<p>Not so healthy huh? I don&rsquo;t like having these thoughts. They drain me and dampen my motivation. What&rsquo;s worse is that I
find myself absorbing a bit of their attitude and will potentially mimic it. I don&rsquo;t know why but I get the feeling my
reaction to this is stronger than others. I wish I could ignore it, but if I could, I clearly wouldn&rsquo;t be writing this
post.</p>

<h2>Strategies for Handling Contemptuous Individuals</h2>

<p>Aurynn&rsquo;s post has a lot of good strategies to handle your own personal contempt, but what I need are ways to handle
other individuals. If I don&rsquo;t, I could see myself getting overly frustrated with the industry again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.drmaciver.com/2015/12/on-criticizing-programming-languages/">This response</a> not only summarizes with a good list on how to deal with your own contempt but
also brought up an interesting observation about identity. The language, tool, framework
becomes an identity of sorts. However, that does bring up the point
categorizing the individual is not healthy. Placing someone in a bucket doesn&rsquo;t move things forward at all.</p>

<ul>
<li>Assume the person is experiencing imposter syndrome and is mimicing others in the field.</li>
<li>Ask why they have such a strong reaction. Try and find the root cause of the reaction.</li>
<li>Redirect the focus to the outcomes. Yes, language X has problems, but look how it is helping Y.</li>
</ul>


<p>A recent EconTalk episode titled <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2016/08/chuck_klosterma.html">&ldquo;What if We&rsquo;re Wrong&rdquo;</a> discusses in the first 10 minutes around
the utility around strong statements. Understanding the individual may better lead to why they feel the need to voice
their disdain so loudly.</p>

<p>Also that contempt culture can take many forms. This year has been full of unhealthy thoughts, but this post is
intended to speak specifically about the programming industry.</p>

<p>Clearly I need some assistance with this. Please leave a comment with your strategies. Or, if this doesn&rsquo;t bother you
much, I would love to hear why.</p>

    <link href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/joining-pivotal-cloud-foundry-and-moving-to-dublin/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-21T21:45:13+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/joining-pivotal-cloud-foundry-and-moving-to-dublin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/pivotal-office.jpg" width="1024"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve posted a &ldquo;life update&rdquo;. The <strong>TL;DR</strong> is that I have joined <a href="http://pivotal.io/platform">Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> in
January and will be moving to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin">Dublin</a> in June.</p>

<h2>Reflections on Berlin and SoundCloud</h2>

<p>My guess is the most frequent question about this is: what happened? When I <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/joining-soundcloud-and-moving-to-berlin/">posted</a> about my decision to
move to Berlin and join SoundCloud it appeared that I had found something I really wanted to do. Looking back at the
post you can see subtle hints of doubt, but went with the option that seemed a little more risky. In the end, the risk
was worth it as I learned a heck of a lot!</p>

<p><strong>The Awesome Stuff</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Berlin has been my favourite city I&rsquo;ve ever lived in. It&rsquo;s modified future projections of where I would like to live
long term. It&rsquo;s a city for humans with its comprehensive public transportation system, low cost of living, and its
openness to new cultures moving to the city.</li>
<li>I felt I managed to fulfill many of the goals I had set in mind in my earlier <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/joining-soundcloud-and-moving-to-berlin/">post</a>. My most important
take-away is having developed empathy for those who speak English as a second language.</li>
<li>More traveling (Ukraine for Easter, Prague, London, Paris, Germany, and Switzerland). There are still so many places
to check out.</li>
<li>New friends (you know who you are)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Not So Awesome Stuff</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Working in the media domain is very different than the public media domain. As monetization became a focus and utilizing
advertising became a core piece of it, I felt that it wasn&rsquo;t a strategy I wanted to participate in. Watching <a href="http://thoughtmaybe.com/the-century-of-the-self/">Century of Self</a>
too many times has probably made me a bit too cynical about advertising.</li>
<li>Really missed the ThoughtWorks culture around software development. I missed pair-programming and the role was more
consulting than it was software-dev (which is one of the reasons why I left ThoughtWorks). At the same time, I learned
how important it is to be aligned with the &ldquo;how we do work&rdquo; at an organisation. I can&rsquo;t say SoundCloud is doing it
wrong&hellip; there&rsquo;s just too little data to make that call. All I know is that it left me drained and unmotivated (but
has the opposite effect for many of the great engineers there).</li>
<li>I injured my hamstrings (and later my back), that definitely affected my life, but unrelated to my decision to move to
Berlin and join SoundCloud.</li>
<li>My personal possessions didn&rsquo;t reach Berlin until July which may have made the whole move feel quite transitory since
I never quite got the chance to settle down properly. I had grown the thought of leaving SoundCloud only just a few
months after my things from Canada had arrived.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What Triggered the Change?</h2>

<p>The funny thing is when I explain the work I was a part of in SoundCloud many folks wonder why I would ever leave. The
technology was interesting and we had a lot of autonomy. This was true, but when it comes to work, I&rsquo;m a process over
product kind of person. After a few events occurred I felt the urge to explore my options. I reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/mkocher">Mathew Kocher</a>
and he said that the offer from a year ago still stands! After living in Berlin, I didn&rsquo;t have much
desire to leave the city let alone move to North America. He encouraged me to go to London and go through another round
of interviews.</p>

<p>In London I had a fantastic day of pairing interviews then a good evening out with <a href="https://twitter.com/tammersaleh">Tammer Saleh</a>. We discussed
many things about the industry (he later was a receipient of my link bombs that I often send out after an evening discussion). I was
definitely engergized about the experience but still wasn&rsquo;t decided. A few weeks later, many people came to Berlin for
the <a href="http://berlin2015.cfsummit.com/">Cloud Foundry Summit</a> and there  was a chance to meet some more people. I expressed that I love Berlin a lot,
and that I wasn&rsquo;t ready to leave Europe. Then the option of Dublin came up. It would allow me to go to SF for 3 months
and move to Ireland in the summertime. If I do want to do consulting again, there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://pivotal.io/locations/berlin">Pivotal Labs office in Berlin</a>.</p>

<p>The energy I had after the pairing sessions still was on my mind. I learned that the 3rd pillar of the company is to &ldquo;Be
Nice&rdquo; and the people I interacted with definitely seemed to espouse this value. After a few more days of discussing the
contract and some e-mail back and forth, I gave my notice to SoundCloud and accepted the offer from Pivotal.</p>

<h2>So What is Happening Now?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ireland_Dublin_Night.JPG"><img class="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Ireland%5FDublin%5FNight.JPG/640px-Ireland%5FDublin%5FNight.JPG" width="640"></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite common for companies to have a 2-3 month notice period. So I had 2 months to finish up my work at SoundCloud
and then figure out the process for a Canadian living in Germany soon to be employed in Ireland but going to begin work
in the USA. I&rsquo;ll spare the details, but I managed to get my passport the day before going to SF.</p>

<p>After 3 weeks I&rsquo;m feeling quite good about my decision. I&rsquo;ve been pairing every single day and really enjoy the people
that I&rsquo;m working with. There&rsquo;s a strong diversity initiative as well, so hopefully the demographics of the organisation
will be just as good as ThoughtWorks. The applications for Cloud Foundry are more large scale and focused on the
Enterprise which I&rsquo;ve learned is an area that I&rsquo;m much more interested in (as opposed to start up products).</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;lived&rdquo; in SF before I&rsquo;m not feeling very rushed. I&rsquo;m spending my days as I normally would with meeting up
with friends periodically dotting my calendar. I&rsquo;m excited about living in Dublin even though I&rsquo;ve never set foot in
Ireland before!</p>

<p>Even my back is feeling a bit better. I managed to do 2 3k runs this weekend. :&ndash;)</p>

    <link href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-resolutions-for-2016/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-02T01:08:42+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-resolutions-for-2016</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post almost didn&rsquo;t happen. 2015 holds a lot of dead-air from me in the blogging world, but I&rsquo;m so compelled by my
routines that I felt that I had to do it! Honouring a self-made routine/tradition is my achilles heel and my biggest
strength at the same time.</p>

<h2>Reflections on <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-resolutions-for-2015/">2015</a></h2>

<p>2015 wasn&rsquo;t a good year for sticking to my goals, but I still learned a lot on the way:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Brew Beer</strong> &ndash; Didn&rsquo;t do well here since I didn&rsquo;t brew a single batch, but there was a lot of taste testing!</li>
<li><strong>Nurture a Healthy Habit</strong> &ndash; The year was off to a great start until I injured my leg. I attempted to get back into
running a bit too strong and injured myself again. If there&rsquo;s something positive I can take from this though is
that I still wish to run. It&rsquo;s been a very frustrating year as a result because I missed running in Berlin during
the best time of the year! I ended up gaining weight, which made me not feel so good about myself and other healthy
habits collapsed as well. The good news is that the desire is still there and I just need get back slowly.</li>
<li><strong>Think More Critically</strong> &ndash; This one is a strange one because I don&rsquo;t have anything countable to associate with it. In the
end I feel more clueless about everything. As I put a critical focus on anything it opens up complexity that I had
never imagined. Now I&rsquo;m not sure how people are so sure about anything! I need to stop listening to so many economics
podcasts ;&ndash;).</li>
</ul>


<p>That being said, I kicked arse on a <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-developer-resolutions-for-2014/">2014 resolution</a> which was to learn <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>! Docker is a core
piece of technology in what I was working on at <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/joining-soundcloud-and-moving-to-berlin/">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

<p>Looking back, 2015 was a difficult year to make such goals. I&rsquo;ve found a lot of interesting tactics on
<a href="http://jamesclear.com/good-habits">James Clear&rsquo;s article about good habits</a>. How would things been different had I set the goal to 1 run
per month? Even with my injury I&rsquo;m sure I would have been more proactive in testing the waters with a single 3k run each month.
Also, why not make the beer brewing goal a single brew for the entire year? I held back on brewing because I was
intimidated by the equipment I would have had to purchase and store. If it was one brew, I would have simply
brewed with the few people that I&rsquo;ve met in Berlin that do home brewing. Then again, it&rsquo;s easy to say that
in retrospect.</p>

<h2>Goal for 2016:</h2>

<p>This year I&rsquo;m going on a bit of a tangent from previous years. I feel I pushed 2015 too hard. It was more work than I
had anticipated. A good challenge but I set my expectations too high. 2016 is likely to be similar with moving to a new
city and starting a new job (post on that coming later this month). So I&rsquo;m only going to make 1 goal. I see it as a
realigning goal, a course correction from the journey that started when I left <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/leaving-a-dream-job-and-going-on-an-adventure/">ThoughtWorks back in 2014</a>.</p>

<h3>Write in a Journal</h3>

<p>I have the urge to write, but the public forum doesn&rsquo;t feel right. A real physical book where my text doesn&rsquo;t flow
through prying eyes wanting to find patterns, so that they can serve me better ads. I&rsquo;ve been
fairly public with my life and I&rsquo;m curious about taking that down a notch. My head feels like a swirling mass of
ideas that hasn&rsquo;t quite found its outlet (though those who have been out drinking with me when the topic of
economics comes up, would beg to differ).</p>

<p>Think of it as close-sourcing my thoughts. Once public, it&rsquo;s hard to make things private, but the other way is
certainly possible.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>A bit of a change from the usual. Let&rsquo;s see how things are in a year, shall we?</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Make Masala Chai]]></title>
    <link href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/how-to-make-masala-chai/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-26T10:22:50+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://scottmuc.com/archive/how-to-make-masala-chai</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/chai/08-chai.jpg" width="300">
This is the simplest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_chai">masala chai</a> recipe I know how to make. Compared to the street side chai you would get in India my
recipe differs in the fact that mine is less sweet and has a strong black tea and masala flavour (especially the ginger).
The wonderful thing about masala chai is that it&rsquo;s easy to adjust to your own taste and it&rsquo;s fun to experiment with.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<h3>Ingredients (for 1 mug)</h3>

<ul>
<li>&frac12; mug of water</li>
<li>&frac12; mug of high fat fresh milk (I use 3.5%)</li>
<li>&frac12; thumb (a unit I made up, but is the approximate size of a thumb) of ginger</li>
<li>3-6 cardamom pods (depending on the freshness and size of the product you have)</li>
<li>1 hand of Brook Bond Taj Mahal tea</li>
<li>1 hand of course-unrefined sugar</li>
</ul>


<h3>Other stuff</h3>

<ul>
<li>heat source (eg: stove)</li>
<li>small pot</li>
<li>strainer</li>
<li>mug</li>
<li>chopping board</li>
<li>knife</li>
</ul>


<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/chai/01-ginger-cardamom-before.jpg" width="510">
<img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/chai/02-ginger-cardamom-after.jpg" width="510"></p>

<p>Cut the ginger into a few pieces and then crush/pound it so that the juices are flowing out. Using the flat of the knife
blade crush the cardamom pods so the seeds inside come out. Place these and the water into a pot and bring it to a boil.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/chai/03-hand-of-tea.jpg" width="330">
<img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/chai/04-steeping-begins.jpg" width="330">
<img class="left" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/chai/05-full-steep.jpg" width="330"></p>

<p>Just before a boil is reached throw in the tea. If the boil is too intense, turn the heat down. Too much heat applied to
the tea will cause it to taste overly bitter. The tea should naturally spread like in the pictures above.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/chai/06-add-sugar.jpg" width="400"></p>

<p>After about 2 minutes, add the milk and set the heat to around medium. Add a hand of sugar now (I&rsquo;ve forgotten to add
sugar a few times so I just try to make it part of the routine at this point). Also remember that you can always add
sugar later. Since I tend to have a sweet snack with my chai, I like to have a less sweet chai to let the dessert
compliment the chai.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/chai/07-hot-break.jpg" width="400"></p>

<p>After several minutes the mixture will start to foam and rise up (I like to call this the hot break which comes from
beer brewing). This means that the proteins in the milk have become denatured (ie: cooked) and this will give you the
lovely brown skin on your chai. Turn down the heat and let the chai continue to brew for a few minutes longer in a soft
rolling boil.</p>

<p>Let the tea cool for a minute and transfer it directly to a mug through a strainer.</p>

<p>Enjoy your masala chai and the fact that your garbage can will smell awesome for days!</p>

<h3>Adjustments</h3>

<p>In order to make more chai, it&rsquo;s just a matter of multiplying all of the ingredients. The limit is usually the size of
the pot. It can be hard to make a large batch when the pot is more than &frac34; full.</p>

<p>Other ingredients you can use to <strong>spice</strong> things up are:</p>

<ul>
<li>cinnamon</li>
<li>fennel</li>
<li>pepper corns</li>
<li>star anise</li>
<li>different chai (though I find Brook Bond Taj Mahal makes for the most consistent results)</li>
<li>chilis</li>
</ul>


<p>What I love of masala chai is that you have an easy method for trying out many different flavours!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This has become a bit of a tradition for me so I can&rsquo;t quite writing these now. This one will be a bit different than
the previous ones though. Normally these posts are my <em>technical</em> resolutions. I&rsquo;m not that ambitious anymore when it
comes to technical learning so I&rsquo;ve dropped that from the title. Even though I tend to despise meaningless dates, I look
at resolutions as one large <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro</a>. So the tradition lives on!</p>

<h2>Reflections on <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-developer-resolutions-for-2014/">2014</a></h2>

<p>Going on a <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/blog/categories/career-break/">career break</a> sort of twisted everything around in 2014. Still, it was interesting to see how
I did:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase Signal to Noise Ration &ndash; I&rsquo;m only following 118 people on Twitter now as opposed to 627, but my &ldquo;friend&rdquo;
count on FaceBook went up to 507 from 480. Considering that Twitter is where most of the noise comes from, I think I
succeeded in this goal.</li>
<li>Learn Docker &ndash; I&rsquo;ve yet to run the docker CLI, so didn&rsquo;t go far with this. I&rsquo;m not terribly interested in it now as my
frustration with tech is still there. 2015 may be a success if I still don&rsquo;t touch docker.</li>
<li>Do Meaningful Work &ndash; Does quitting my job and traveling the world for 9 months count as success? It does to me so I
think I slayed this resolution! I&rsquo;m also getting back into the <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/joining-soundcloud-and-moving-to-berlin/">workforce</a> with a company that is in a domain I care
about and I&rsquo;ve gotten the opportunity to be on the board of advisors for an interesting <a href="http://zolair-energy.com/">clean energy start up</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Goals for 2015:</h2>

<p>I think the time off has given me a new perspective. These goals are more about looking at myself externally and
figuring out what kind of design changes to I want to make on myself.</p>

<h3>Brew Beer</h3>

<p>Given that I want to look into the business of beer, it would help if I&rsquo;ve actually brewed some. I believe brewing 10
batches is a reasonable goal. If I can&rsquo;t do this, then I can safely drop the idea of building a beer related business in
the future. I enjoy publishing my <a href="https://twitter.com/todayschai">chai</a> experiments and I&rsquo;ll do the same thing with my beer brewing. Will
probably publish them on this blog for now.</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>: 0 batches brewed</p>

<h3>Nurture a Healthy Habit</h3>

<p>Over the last 15 years of my life I&rsquo;ve ridden a health rollercoaster. I can&rsquo;t recall any year where I didn&rsquo;t go
off the routine and regress to my old unhealthy habits. This year I&rsquo;m aiming to be more proactive around my habits and
plan a bit better when I can see potential for a habit to break (eg: when traveling, or a busy period). My goal is run
at least 10 times every month. Be sure to verify my results on <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/6575733">Strava</a>. I am training for a half marathon but
this is very typical of my health ambitions. Do something big, and then stop.</p>

<p><strong>January</strong>: 19 runs<br/>
<strong>February</strong>: 13 runs<br/>
<strong>March</strong>: 6 runs (strained hamstring injury)<br/>
<strong>April</strong>:<br/>
<strong>May</strong>:<br/>
<strong>June</strong>:<br/>
<strong>July</strong>:<br/>
<strong>August</strong>:<br/>
<strong>September</strong>:<br/>
<strong>October</strong>:<br/>
<strong>November</strong>:<br/>
<strong>December</strong>:<br/></p>

<h3>Think More Critically</h3>

<p>This could be due to having a lot of time to consume too much media over the last year, but I feel that I should be more
thoughtful in my communication and critical of my messages. It&rsquo;s easy to type out a pithy tweet skipping a load of
context. When being critical I will do due dilligence in citing research when trying to impose my ideas, or at least be
more transparent in pointing out how much is anecdotal. This one is a tougher one to measure. The only thing I can think
of is comparing the number of tweets over the course of the years, and having source lists in all my blog posts (or
stating the source are my own observations and are completely theoretical).</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>When reading my <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/my-developer-resolutions-for-2014/">2014 post</a> I can tell that I was getting jaded about the IT industry. It looks like I&rsquo;m still a bit
jaded, but this time I&rsquo;m steering the ship away from IT a bit. Let&rsquo;s see what these new waters are like.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/career-break/blr-lake.large.jpg" width="800"></p>

<p>Ugh, I left this post until way too late. Unfortunately I&rsquo;ll have to drop a lot of detail as 3 months is pretty hard to
sum up in a single blog post. Hopefully I can do it justice as India is a place I&rsquo;m very fond of. I feel bad for all the
wonderful little experiences that happened and didn&rsquo;t get written about. I&rsquo;ll just have to visit India again and
properly journal the whole experience.</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>

<p><a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/career-break/blr-flood.jpg"><img class="right" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/career-break/blr-flood.medium.jpg" width="200"></a>
The minute I got off the plane I was greeted with the familiar scent of Bangalore. The city gives me a bizarre sense of
being home. My arrival to India this time around is much different than the paniced call to Calgary at 4am where my
arrange pickup wasn&rsquo;t there. This time I breezed through the crowd to the taxi line and made my way to Indiranagar where
I was to stay in a wonderful <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/1009953">guest house</a> for the next long while.</p>

<p>It was the end of monsoon season and there was a bit more rain than last time. It was quite refreshing because it kept
the air clean for a little while. There was one evening where the road leading up to my apartment was flooded and had to
wade through knee deep &ldquo;water&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Work Life Balance</h3>

<p>My goal in India was to finish my job search and just chill out for a little while. But first, I had to find a place
where I could hang out for most of the day to use the Internet. I first tried <a href="http://www.cobaltblr.com/">Cobalt</a> which was on Church St,
just a few minutes away from MG Road metro station. It had good Internet and there were other people around that made it
feel nice. The next day I tried <a href="http://www.beaglesloft.com/">Beaglesloft</a> as it was started by an ex-ThoughtWorker. It was a short walk from Trinity metro station, and it was decent too. A bit too quiet though.</p>

<h3>Finding Nilenso</h3>

<p>There was one more place to check out. An ex-ThoughtWorker, <a href="https://twitter.com/deobald">Steve</a> from Calgary, has lived in Bangalore for a
while and has is part of a software collective called <a href="http://nilenso.com/">Nilenso</a>. I also recommend reading his
<a href="http://blog.deobald.ca/">blog</a> as he is an excellent writer and has written some very insightful posts about life.</p>

<p>After one day of hanging out with the folks at Nilenso I had realized I had found my home. The whole group was extremely
welcoming to me. I had met Steve once before (for like around 5 minutes) and didn&rsquo;t know the others yet I now consider
them friends and will visit them every time I go back to Bangalore. They set me up with good Internet, a workstation
setup and meals! It was really hard not to apply and work with them. They also were excellent test subjects for my
<a href="https://twitter.com/todayschai">chai experiments</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/career-break/blr-chai.large.jpg" width="800"></p>

<h3>Pune</h3>

<p>After a few weeks I scheduled a trip to Pune to see some old friends and meet a company for a job interview. I had
Internet issues at the place I was staying at so I had to go to Starbucks nearly everyday for interviews and other
correspondance.</p>

<p>The job interview went really well, but declined to pursue the job any further as it felt like it would be ThoughtWorks
part 2. I used the down time to write a couple blog posts and do a little cooking.</p>

<h3>Chennai</h3>

<p>I wanted to meet some friends in Chennai as well so I did another short outing to see them. Besides eating awesome South
Indian food all day long I collaborated with <a href="https://twitter.com/rdsubhas">Subhas Dandapani</a> on <a href="http://www.devopsbookmarks.com/">devopsbookmarks.com</a>. All I
really did was &ldquo;project manage&rdquo; and Subhas essentially did all the work.</p>

<h3>Beer Tour</h3>

<p>Bangalore has a beer scene that&rsquo;s growing strong. In this trip alone I was able to visit 10 brewpubs and that&rsquo;s not
hitting them all!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://toit.in/">Toit</a> &ndash; Definitely one of my favourites. I think I went there at least once a week. I highly recommend their
weiss beer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.murphysbrewhouse.in/">Murphy&rsquo;s</a> &ndash; Only went their once for lunch. None of their beers really stood out to me. I regret not going
again because the view is quite nice.</li>
<li><a href="http://windmillscraftworks.com/">Windmills</a> &ndash; Overall, I think Windmills makes the best beer in Bangalore. It&rsquo;s a bit of a trek because
it&rsquo;s all the way in Whitefield.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.barleyz.com/">Barleyz</a> &ndash; The beer isn&rsquo;t that great, but the rooftop terrace is a good reason to go there. All the beers
tasted too watery.</li>
<li><a href="http://thebiereclub.com/">Biere Club</a> &ndash; A decent spot with decent beers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.arborbrewing.com/locations/india/">Arbor</a> &ndash; Arbor always shows up as the place to go for the best beer in Bangalore. I do think the beer is ok,
but it&rsquo;s not even close to Windmills in quality. I also found their beer gave me an allergic reaction. The beer is not
filtered and I know sometimes that can affect me, but it was more pronounced there.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/VapourBangalore">Vapour</a> &ndash; I ignored this spot for a while due to people around me saying it wasn&rsquo;t very good. While not all
beers were of consistent quality, the red ale was pretty good and their weiss beer was decent too. It&rsquo;s also a nice
roof top patio that serves decent food.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bigpitcher">Big Pitcher</a> &ndash; A giant establishment. Only checked it out once. There were a couple decent beers, but
the others tasted really off.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.brewsky.in/">Brewsky</a> &ndash; Best IPA I&rsquo;ve had in India. The dunkel was also really good, but the rest were quite bad.</li>
<li><a href="http://prost.in/">Prost</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve heard mixed reviews about the beers, but I found them to be pretty good. The Big Ben ale reminds
me a lot of the English Bay Pale Ale, which is an old favourite of mine. Their stout is quite good too, which is a
beer that doesn&rsquo;t seem to get much love in other Bangalore pubs.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Pun Town</h3>

<p>One of the reasons why Bangalore is close to my heart has to be their love of puns. Here are some of the stores that
were within 1km of where I was staying:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blind Love</li>
<li>Berry&#8217;ed Alive</li>
<li>Phobidden Fruit</li>
<li>Wearhouse</li>
<li>Infinitea</li>
<li>Chaipatty</li>
</ul>


<h3>Oh, and I Got a Job!</h3>

<p>Over the course of a few months I had interviewed with several companies. It was interesting trying to manage all of
this while moving around and being in terribly inconvenient time zones. I&rsquo;ve already <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/joining-soundcloud-and-moving-to-berlin/">written</a> and huge post
about the job hunt process. Now I have a blog that if read in order really doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>All and all, this trip to India is a very stark contrast compared to my previous visit. I didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot of
traveling. It was really a low-key retreat so that I could do lots of reading, podcast listening, computering, and
reflecting. Sort of makes me wish I wrote about my previous trip because that one was definitely a lot more things going
on, but this trip was exactly what I needed/wanted.</p>

    <updated>2014-12-10T05:09:27+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://instagram.com/p/LepNTRLlIB/"><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/running/venice.jpg" width="700"></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been an off and on jogger for the last 2 years, but my goal is to be a jogger for the rest of my life. For some
reason I&rsquo;ve felt compelled to journal my reasons. If one person thinks to take up jogging, then that would be wonderful.</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/">The Oatmeal</a> made a fantastic comic of his reasons for running and found that there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap. Of
course I don&rsquo;t run ultra marathons, nor have I been running for a decade, but I find this comic inspirational and I look
at it every couple months. Please read his comic, it&rsquo;s that good!</p>

<p><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running"><img class="center" src="https://scottmuc.com/archive/images/blog/running/oatmeal.png" width="700"></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Growing up as a chubby person I can identify with the <strong>Blerch</strong>.</li>
<li>I definitely look at running as an asset to my eating balance sheet. Dieting makes life more complex so I choose the
simple approach of not being picky about what I eat. If it&rsquo;s unhealthy, then I try to control my portion size.</li>
<li>My expectations around how I&rsquo;ll look are realistic. It&rsquo;s that I love how I <strong>feel</strong> when I&rsquo;m running. My waistline may
not change but I have become comfortable with my body when I run. If that starts meaning more to me then I&rsquo;ll add
other forms of exercise to my routine.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Simplicity</h3>

<p>One of my favourite talks is by <a href="https://twitter.com/richhickey">Rich Hickey</a>, called <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>. It&rsquo;s funny that I
associate a software talk with life habits rather than software. I use running to explain the concepts to people that
confuse the term simple and easy. The simplicity of running is a major reason I like it so much. There&rsquo;s very little in
the way of dependencies that you need. A decent pair of shoes is pretty much it, and perhaps climate appropriate
clothing. The only thing stopping you from doing it is your own will power. Making it harder is simply a matter of adding
distance. It&rsquo;s liberating to not own expensive equipment or have a contract with some sleezy gym. I can just put on my
shoes and run.</p>

<h3>Mood Altering</h3>

<p>I used to wonder if I exercised more when I was in a good mood, or if I got into a good mood after exercise. My personal
anecdotal experience is that people used to notice my changed mood and would ask &ldquo;did you work out, you&rsquo;re behaving&hellip; a
bit too happy&rdquo;. This has added benefits to my work and my learning. This is backed up by science in the class I took
called: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/learning">Learning how to Learn</a> (I did a <a href="https://scottmuc.com/archive/book-review-a-mind-for-numbers-by-barbara-oakley/">book review</a> for it too)</p>

<h3>Encourages Good Behaviour</h3>

<p>When I make a running goal I become very disciplined around good habits. I signed up the
<a href="http://www.vattenfall-berliner-halbmarathon.de/en/">Berlin Half Marathon</a> and I&rsquo;m much more inclined to not have a 2nd beer in the evening getting up at 6am
has becoming easier and easier. I&rsquo;ve signed up for the <a href="http://jamesclear.com/">James Clear</a> newsletter and one article really
struck home with me as I build up habits. I now know that I need to avoid the <a href="http://jamesclear.com/second-mistake">Second Mistake</a> otherwise
my habit will fall apart. This gives me the allowance to miss a run and not feel like a complete failure. Instead my
mind switchs to the thought that I <strong>MUST</strong> not miss my next run. It sounds so simple and I can&rsquo;t believe I never
noticed this before in my behaviour. My habits drop when I make my second mistake consistently. Again, I like how this
concent is backed up by science. Armed with this I intend to be an off-and-on runner no more!</p>

<h3>Health?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s odd, but the health aspects of running are a secondary benefit to me. Though a potentially
<a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com//2014/12/03/run-to-stay-young/">real good one</a>. Then again, most of the other benfits of running are also healthy. Let&rsquo;s just say
that my aim with running is not to be skinnier and athletic, though I won&rsquo;t complain if those things happen as a result
of running.</p>

<h3>The Only Social Media Spam I Always Like</h3>

<p>We all complain about the huge amount of information that comes our way. From baby pictures, wedding pictures, or
political kibitzing, our mood affects how we ingest these pieces. For me, I can safely say that I <strong>LOVE</strong> it when
people post their fitness accomplishments. It comes across as encouraging. So I have to shout out a big thank you to
<a href="https://twitter.com/hiyasmind">Hiyasmin</a> for catalyzing this new hobby of mine. Another thank you goes to the South Africa crew (pictured below)
who egged me on to join a trail run series. If you wish to give me encouragement, please add me on <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/6575733">Strava</a>.</p>
