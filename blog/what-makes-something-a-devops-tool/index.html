			<h1>What Makes Something a &#34;Devops&#34; Tool?</h1>
			<div>
				<p>The term &ldquo;devops&rdquo; has only existed for 5 years and the trend is to label your tool as a devops tool in order for it to
gain traction. When I look at the landscape of tools, most look like Ops tools, just relabeled.</p>
<p>The reason this has been on my mind is that myself and <a href="twitter.com/rdsubhas">Subhas</a> released a website called
<a href="http://www.devopsbookmarks.com/">Devops Bookmarks</a> to aggregate all the tools in the landscape. Using a <a href="https://github.com/devopsbookmarks/devopsbookmarks.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Github Pull Request</a>
for contributions results in reviewing a lot of tools and after a short amount of time I found myself second-guessing
the need for such a website. It felt that we were diluting the devops term.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a couple that I think got it wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.xebialabs.com/2014/04/30/taxonomy/">http://blog.xebialabs.com/2014/04/30/taxonomy/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://newrelic.com/devops/toolset">http://newrelic.com/devops/toolset</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m greatly concerned the Devops Bookmarks is going to feel the same unless context is added to support the inclusion of
the tools. It&rsquo;s why I made a <a href="/valuable-links-devops/">devops links post</a> on my blog so that I could explain a little
bit why something is included.</p>
<h3 id="going-to-the-gembagemba">Going To the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemba">Gemba</a></h3>
<p>Honestly, <a href="http://www.jedi.be/blog/">Patrick Debois&rsquo;s</a> blog is a must read to get adequate context around devops. He has an
excellent <a href="http://www.jedi.be/blog/2010/02/12/what-is-this-devops-thing-anyway/">introductory post</a> (written almost 5 years ago) and he&rsquo;s made an excellent slide deck pointing
out the same concepts I&rsquo;m struggling with right now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In that presentation the point of articulating desired <em>Behaviours</em> is very clear. To me a devops tool is something that
promotes good behaviour if it&rsquo;s executed well. The desired behaviours are cleary represented by
<a href="https://twitter.com/botchagalupe">John Willis&rsquo;</a> excellent blog post titled: <a href="https://www.chef.io/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/">What Devops Means to Me</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chef</strong> - promotes the behaviour of automating the configuration of machines. This reduces the tribal knowledge and
provides a collaborative environment to work on this automation (because it&rsquo;s now code instead of a Word doc).</li>
<li><strong>Vagrant</strong> - enables the ability to create production like environments anywhere. All roles in the software lifecycle
work with consistent infrastructure, thus can share their improvements and feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Gauntlt</strong> - security testing for humans. Using Cucumber, security tests can be easily read by everyone and the tests
can be executed in a continuous integration pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Not Sure About These</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gitorious</strong> - is it a devops tool because having source control is necessary?</li>
<li><strong>Static Analysis</strong> - is a python static analysis tool really a devops tool? What about something like Puppet Lint?</li>
</ul>
<p>Are some tools purely dev, and some purely ops? Everything lies on a spectrum and I guess what I&rsquo;m wondering is if
devops tools are simply the ones that are in the middle of that spectrum.</p>
<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m torn, but I think a feature in <a href="http://www.devopsbookmarks.com/">Devops Bookmarks</a> should be a requirement to explain why the tools
is a devops tool, and what behaviours does it try to support. If no explanation is provided, then it cannot be listed.</p>
<p>Currently the website is broken down by <em>Topics</em>, but that could change to <em>Behaviours</em> and the tools can be tagged with
the behaviours that it supports.</p>
<p>Consider this a request for comments.</p>
