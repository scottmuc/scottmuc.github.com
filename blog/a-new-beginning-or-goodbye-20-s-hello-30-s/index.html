<div class="entry-content"><p>As many of you know, I have left CBC Radio 3 and got a position as a Software Consultant with Thoughtworks Calgary.
Considering that I have lived my entire life in the lower mainland of BC this is a big change. Not only am I leaving
behind many friends and family, a beautiful city, and a great job, I&rsquo;m also leaving behind my golf membership <em>gasp</em>. At
least with the Internet, it&rsquo;s easy to remain in touch and this blog is one of the many ways I&rsquo;ll be keeping in touch.</p>

<h2>How It All Started</h2>

<p>Sometime in August I saw a job posting from Thoughtworks on the Stackoverflow jobs board. I&rsquo;ve met with many people from
Thoughtworks at conferences and read many of their blogs. These people are inspiring and were the main reason I dusted
off the old CV. Although I&rsquo;m not sure how you dust off something that&rsquo;s writting in XHTML.</p>

<p>Many months went by and I did not hear from them, so I just shrugged it off and kept trucking along at Radio 3. It
wasn&rsquo;t until I was near the final stages of releasing the latest and greatest version of the CBC Radio 3 website (kudos
to everyone I worked with on it!), where I get a phone call from an HR person at Thoughtworks. I was at work at the time
and it was hard to hold back the excitement. Little did I know how much effort the application process takes.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into too many details about the Thoughtworks interview process as there are already numerous posts out their
describing essentially the same thing I went though. I do, however, want to thank all of those involved for making it
such a positive experience. They really test your metal and I feel that getting hired is an accomplishment in itself. I
also have to give a big thank you to Suzi Edwards who lead the whole process; she is a delight to speak with, has great
taste in music, and made me feel comfortable every step of the way.</p>

<h2>Leaving Vancouver</h2>

<p>After about a month and half of the hiring process I finally find out I&rsquo;m hired early December. This gave me
approximately 3 weeks to find a place in Calgary, coordinate with movers, and transport myself to Calgary. Not only
that, I had to provide my notice to CBC Radio 3 which was probably the most bittersweet task of my life.</p>

<p>In my heart I was absolutely thrilled to have this opportunity, but I know it&rsquo;s hard for those I know and love to have
the same feeling about it as I do. I learned how much Radio 3 meant to me and it hit me that I&rsquo;m leaving behind far more
than I initially thought. They gave me a send off of epic proportions and for that I&rsquo;m so grateful. Not only that, but
to also have spent the majority of my twenties among such great people.</p>

<h2>The Move</h2>

<p>For some reason the entire move went without a hitch. The movers were awesome, the place I found is great, and my car
made it there with no issues. I&rsquo;ve been told I live a charmed life and I&rsquo;m really starting to believe that now.</p>

<p>I left for Calgary shortly after Christmas and decided to drive my car there. The main reason is because I had so much
time, and that I thought driving was a better transition than hopping on a plane. It felt more like a real move, rather
than just a hop on a flying bus and magically arriving in an hour to another time zone.</p>

<p>It was the first time I&rsquo;ve driven through the rockies in the winter time and the beauty was just astounding. The second
day of driving after Golden, I went from the tight embrace of the mountains and the trees to gentle rolling hills, then
the prairie. That&rsquo;s when it really hit me that I&rsquo;m not going back to Vancouver (well, I am, but you know what I mean).
It dawned on me that this is a one way trip and that I&rsquo;m staying in this big skied land for some time.</p>

<p>Since things seem to always go my way, Rocky (the mover) called me and said the he could arrive with the truck an hour
after I arrive. This is a full day ahead of schedule which meant I would have my own bed to sleep on right away. When I
enter my new home I loved it immediately.</p>

<h2>The Home</h2>

<p>Many people have been wanting pictures so here they are:</p>

<p>The entrance is a really long hallway. It actually works out really well as a place to store my bike, and put many other
miscalenous items.</p>

<p>The living room is my favourite room in the place. It&rsquo;s got a really big window facing the street. The dining room is
probably going to be a lot of wasted space. The only things I have in there are: the jukebox, kitchen table and chairs,
plus a bunch of boxes for recycling materials.</p>

<p>In the office I have a couple book shelves and my desk. The empty part of the room is where some sort of futon will go
so guests can stay over. I actually like my like office area. Once I get it a bit more organized I can see myself being
quite productive in there.</p>

<p>The kitchen is still a work in progress. It&rsquo;s not all hooked up yet so I won&rsquo;t be cooking for at least another week.
What I love about the room is the pantry and the large south facing window. A lot of natural light gets in there.
Outside the window is the patio. I also have some input on how the kitchen gets completed so I would love to hear any
ideas from anyone out there.</p>

<p>My two least favourite rooms are the bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom is a massive room but with only the one window.
All I have in there right now is my bed and dresser. I could do without the dresser because the room comes with two
large closets as well. I guess with all that space I can wake up straight into some yoga poses!</p>

<p>The bathroom is extremely small and is also not quite complete. One of the things I took for granted at my last home was
the large bathroom and the laundry room. I&rsquo;m already missing those things right now.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s my new place. It&rsquo;s probably way too much space for me right now, but maybe with a couple pieces of furniture
and some wall pieces it will have a bit more personality in the rooms where it&rsquo;s lacking. It&rsquo;s nice not having the
feeling of living in a shoebox at least.</p>

<h2>Calgary</h2>

<p>So far adjusting to Calgary has been way easier than expected. The coldest it&rsquo;s been so far has been -26C and it really
didn&rsquo;t bother me. I went out with my normal jacket and a t-shirt and felt fine. Gloves and a toque were definitely
needed, but when only walking a few blocks the cold doesn&rsquo;t really hit you. The one thing that has struck me about this
city is that they barely have a recycling program. My building doesn&rsquo;t have any recycling service, just a dumpster where
people put everything in (that includes cardboard, food waste, can, bottles, and paper). The Shaw guy that hooked up my
Internet laughed when I said I look forward to a paperless society when he asked if I wanted a bill in the post or in
e-mail. He said &ldquo;you know you&rsquo;re in Calgary, right?&rdquo;. He was from Toronto and also learned recycling from an early age.
The good thing is the superintendant here, Frank, is on the same page and we&rsquo;re going to start a little in building
recycling program.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my little summary of the last few weeks. Tomorrow is my first day at Thoughtworks and the itinerary states that I
don&rsquo;t need to be in til 11am! I&rsquo;ve still set my alarm to 7am because I need to get out of this vacation mode I&rsquo;m on
right now. That&rsquo;s it for now, please comment with any furniture ideas that come to mind.</p>
