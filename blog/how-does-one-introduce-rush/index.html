			<h1>How Does One Introduce Rush?</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Earlier this year I was chatting with a friend about the band Rush. I said they
played a fundamental part of who I am and still have an impact on me today.
This prompted them to ask how they could learn more. The most wonderful thing
for any Rush fan to hear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start by describing how I learnt about them. It was through my brothers
who are older than me and they still joke about how as a child I would giggle
to <a href="https://youtu.be/JnC88xBPkkc?feature=shared&amp;t=224">this guitar part</a> in The Trees. A few years later, as I
started learning how to play guitar, they suggested I learn songs like YYZ and
Kid Gloves. I was immediately hooked to learning as much Rush as possible on
guitar. Eventually I made an <a href="https://home.scottmuc.com/rushquiz/">online quiz</a> playing snippets of Rush
songs on classical guitar. See if you can find YYZ and Kid Gloves there.</p>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve grown to appreciate the lyrics as much as their musicianship. I
explained to my friend how I enjoy more than just the music. I&rsquo;ve also grown to
appreciate the whole back story of the band. I love the relationship they have
with each other and how they&rsquo;ve stuck to their creative vision with the
rebellious, but liberating, 2112 release. They&rsquo;ve inspired me to get better at
what I do, to stand up for my creative decisions, and to foster that
inner-child.</p>
<p>Neil Peart passing away is one of the few celebrity deaths that made me
emotional. It encouraged me to get more of my own thoughts into writing because
I can appreciate how ones spirit can live on, just like Neil&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So with all that being said, how does one introduce Rush? How can I possibly
convey how I feel about this band by suggesting a few songs to listen to? With
20 albums there&rsquo;s no singular way to start.</p>
<p>These few suggestions are intended to shed a light on the evolution of the
band&rsquo;s sound along with a lyrics focus. I love all of these songs, but they
might not be the best samples to make you like the band. I do hope they
communicate why I love the band beyond their musicianship.</p>

<p>Moving Pictures is their 8th and most commercially successful album. It has
songs like Tom Sawyer and Limelight which you may have heard before. I chose
this song because it exemplifies their ability to make music that tells a story
(not just with the lyrics). The intro to the solo sounds like a revving engine
and the tone on the guitar during the solo sounds like changing gears.</p>
<p>Honourable mention also goes to the following <a href="https://genius.com/Rush-witch-hunt-part-iii-of-fear-lyrics">lyrics from Witch Hunt</a>
which is part of a reverse trilogy of songs that span multiple albums on the topic of fear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quick to judge, quick to anger<br>
Slow to understand<br>
Ignorance and prejudice<br>
And fear walk hand in hand</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just 1 year later they release Signals which introduces a lot more 80s like
synth sounds. Some folks call this the point where Rush started to suck. I&rsquo;m
not one of those. This song (and its excellent video) resonated with me
strongly as a child. It captures that feeling of wanting to be yourself, but
also wanting to belong. In Canada, the suburban upbringing is a common
experience when growing up. I was also made fun of a lot for liking Rush as I
was growing up and this song reminds me of those moments.</p>
<p>The line that is so relatable is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some will sell their dreams for small desires</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a lyric that I think about often and why Rush has had a profound impact
on my life.</p>
<p>Analog Kid also gets an honourable mention for the following line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too many hands on my time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This motivates me as I pursue financial independence.</p>

</div>

<p>Presto is an often ignored album, but it&rsquo;s the first album of theirs that I
remember being released. I have a strong memory of my brothers coming home from
the record store (A&amp;B Sound) and the excitement of putting it into the CD
player (I was 9).</p>
<p>The song has a main topic (environmental impact) and a secondary topic (AIDS).
Neil Peart was a well read person and his lyrics showed his breadth and wasn&rsquo;t
shy about sharing an opinion on a subject.</p>
<h2 id="color-of-right-test-for-echo-1996test-for-echo-wiki">Color of Right (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_for_Echo">Test For Echo 1996</a>)</h2>

</div>

<p>This album has an impact on me because it was released when I was a teenager.
Rush albums have a general theme. Test For Echo to me has a theme around group
association, group selection, tribe, beliefs, us vs them, etc. Another example
is their album Roll the Bones which covers the theme of luck, chance, and risk.</p>
<p>This song feels as relevant today as it did back then. It&rsquo;s not very detailed,
but to me it suggests to not bear the weight of the problems of the world on
your back. Also, what is right is a matter of perspective and cautions against
being so black and white about a topic.</p>
<p>To emphasize how with the times Neil&rsquo;s lyrics were, check out
<a href="https://genius.com/Rush-virtuality-lyrics">Virtuality</a> and keep in mind that this was released in
1996.</p>

<p>I never heard this song until this year! Not sure why I never looked into it.
When it was released I was wasn&rsquo;t really paying attention. As the years went
by, and knowing that Rush was most likely done, I feared hearing an album of
theirs I might not like. Heh, I was so wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, but I felt proud of them for making incredible music on their 20th
album. They never settled for &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;. It prompts me to think about what
dimensions of my life do I not settle for &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;? Good enough is
practically my catchphrase for most of what I do so this poses an interesting
question for me to ponder right now.</p>
<p>This song being their last song on their last album hits me hard. The lyrics to
me communicate some form of farewell. It also has an incredible lyric:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect;<br>
So hard to earn, so easily burned</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well said Neil.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This is an in-the-moment sample of Rush songs I drew up without thinking too
hard about it. I don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;top x&rdquo; lists as I don&rsquo;t believe ranking art is
that useful of an exercise. I hope this little story along with some samples at
least provides a glimpse to how Rush has had an impact on me in some dimension.</p>
<p>One could argue that there&rsquo;s a personal story being projected with this list.
I&rsquo;ve recently written about <a href="/blog/a-fresh-start-in-midlife/">my reflections on reaching midlife</a>.
Many of these songs describe a bit of a filtering of the the world outside
oneself so one can focus on the self. I want to belong, but I don&rsquo;t want to
sacrifice who I am to do it. I care about the environment, but I cannot let it
keep me up at night. I want to do good, but I need to reflect on if I&rsquo;m virtue
signalling. As someone who&rsquo;s not adept at describing their feelings and
emotions, I find Rush gives me a palette to paint a picture to the
question &ldquo;what&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what are you thinking?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve listened to the songs and they&rsquo;ve piqued your interest and you&rsquo;re
curious to learn more. The documentary, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1545103/">Beyond the Lighted Stage</a>,
tells a vivid story of their origin and evolution while often showcasing their
wonderful sense of humour.</p>
