			<h1>Desktop As My Default Download Location</h1>
			<div>
				<p>So I&rsquo;ve been getting into the book <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things Done</a> lately and can identify with many of the ideas it discusses. The one idea I really like is the consolidation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done#Collect">Inboxes</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of the camp that likes to have a pristine desktop. I personally think the desktop should never be seen, and if it is then you&rsquo;re not managing your windows properly. When things go on my desktop I naturally try to clean them up. I don&rsquo;t need any application launchers because I use <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a> for that.</p>
<p>In the past I used to use a dedicated <em>Downloads</em> folder. What has always happened was a convoluted mess of files that I had no idea what they were or not sure if I even needed them. Since the folder was sort of out of the way I let it get messy. Since I already know I&rsquo;m crazy about keeping my desktop clean I thought it would be interesting to make it my default download location. The result is that I&rsquo;ve been diligent in following <em>GTD</em> actions with the files! If I need the file once I&rsquo;m quick to delete it. If it&rsquo;s important for something later I put it into a hold folder, and the last case is that I store it for reference.</p>
<p>This probably all sounds obvious, but reading GTD is like reading a <a href="http://www.dofactory.com/">design patterns book</a>. Instead of everything looking like a singleton or a factory, I see things in their context, project, and next action.</p>
