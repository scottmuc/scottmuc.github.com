    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/podcast.jpg" width="300">
It&rsquo;s quite surprising that I haven&rsquo;t really brought up the topic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasts</a> on my blog considering that
I&rsquo;ve been consuming them for almost 10 years! My methods and taste have changed a lot over the years. I want a place
to point people when asked about what podcasts I listen to, and with a little more context than just a pure list.</p>

<h2>Software / Tools</h2>

<p>A podcast is such a simple concept (from the technical side) that it allows for a lot of tools and applications to be
created around the idea. Nowadays I pretty much use a single application on my phone. I&rsquo;m generally only concerned with
the mobile experience since I try to listen to podcasts when I&rsquo;m on the move and when I&rsquo;m not focusing on work. Ask me
to listen to a podcast while programming and you&rsquo;ll discover that I won&rsquo;t be able to recall anything from the podcast
(or that I don&rsquo;t do any programming). The application I use is <a href="http://www.shiftyjelly.com/android/pocketcasts">PocketCasts</a>. The homepage is full of
hyperbole and non-truthes (eg: &hellip; deliver the updates instantly&hellip;), but it&rsquo;s an alright application and fits my needs for
now. Most importantly, it allows me to export my subscribed shows as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opml">OPML file</a> which I&rsquo;ve made
<a href="/podcasts_opml.xml">available to you</a>.</p>

<h2>What I Am Listening to Now</h2>

<p>Podcasts are a great way to tap into interests of all different types. You&rsquo;ll notice that only a few are related to my
professional life. Listening to podcasts is a wonderful activity and I do get a lot out of them, there becomes a point
where you&rsquo;ve found too much good content and there isn&rsquo;t enough time to listen to them all.</p>

<h2>Economics</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.econtalk.org/">EconTalk</a><a href="http://www.econtalk.org/rss.xml"><img src="http://scottmuc.com/images/feed-icon-28x28.png" class="podcast-image" /></a></h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/econtalk.jpg" width="200">
I begun listening to this show at the beginning of my <a href="/blog/categories/career-break/">career break</a>. The
host, <a href="http://russroberts.info/">Russ Roberts</a>, does a great job of letting the guests speak without pushing his views too often.
It&rsquo;s honestly changed how I think about problems in the world and how to best approach them. Economics is becoming a
tool that I use to help me understand how things are, and how to possibly alter them. The talks are well balanced and
help me see the other side of issues that I normally don&rsquo;t think of. When a new episode appears I look forward to
listening to it regardless of the topic!</p>

<p><strong>Favourites:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/05/charles_marohn.html">Charles Marohn on Strong Towns, Urban Development, and the Future of American Cities</a> &ndash; Conversations
around city design always fascinates me. There&rsquo;s a spectrum of that&rsquo;s a lot harder to accomplish than most people
realize. Living in an overly-designed city can be soul crushing, and a zero designed city can be too stressful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/05/yuval_levin_on.html">Yuval Levin on Burke, Paine, and the Great Debate</a> &ndash; The difference between the right and left had been
something I hadn&rsquo;t thought deeply about. This conversation made me realize I&rsquo;m more right thinking than I thought. It
also made me understand that neither are &ldquo;bad&rdquo;.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/09/martha_nussbaum.html">Martha Nussbaum on Creating Capabilities and GDP</a> &ndash; There are other conversations around GDP, but this one
really stood out to me. I think Martha does an exceptional job of explaining how GDP is not a sufficient metric and
that we still have a long way to go to get people to the top of Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/slate-money.png" width="200">
Yet another podcast that talks about world events and how they affect the economy. Each episode covers 2-4 topics. This
is starting become one of my required listening podcasts to stay informed about current events. The hosts discuss the
economics in a way that&rsquo;s targetted for people who don&rsquo;t know all the lingo.</p>

<p><strong>Favourites:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/slate_money/2016/08/slate_money_takes_on_epipen_passive_investing_and_hedge_funds.html">The Worse than Marxism Edition</a> &ndash; As someone interested (and doing) passive investing, I wanted to
hear what they had to say about it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/slate_money/2016/08/slate_money_on_three_of_today_s_top_online_products.html">The Product Edition</a> &ndash; Anything with Paul Ford is great to listen to. He has a nice down-to-earth
style of describing what Product Development is all about.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/slate_money/2016/06/slate_money_on_microsoft_s_acquisition_of_linkedin.html">The I&rsquo;d Like to Add You to my Professional Network Edition</a> &ndash; Another Paul Ford episode and it was
interesting to hear the conversation about the reasoning as to why such a massive purchase could happen.</li>

<h2>Culture and Curiosities</h2>

<h3><a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a><a href="http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/99percentinvisible"><img src="http://scottmuc.com/images/feed-icon-28x28.png" class="podcast-image" /></a></h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/99pi.png" width="200">
Now one of my favourites. You never know what to expect with this show because the
enigmatic host, <a href="https://twitter.com/romanmars">Roman Mars</a>, always finds something interesting that you likely have no idea about.
Roman started a group called <a href="http://www.radiotopia.fm/">Radiotopia</a> which is a collective of like minded artists to create
exceptional podcasts.</p>

<p><strong>Favourites (all of them):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/thomassons/">Thomassons</a> &ndash; I dare you to listen to this episode and not look for Thomassons wherever you go!</li>
<li><a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-straight-line-is-a-godless-line/">The Straight Line is a Godless Line</a> &ndash; Given that I was in Vienna and saw the Hundertwasserhaus, it
was very interesting to hear more about the architect. I love the fact that people like him exist, though I may not
want to completely follow his lead.</li>
<li><a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/clean-trains/">Clean Trains</a> &ndash; There are so many applications to the lesson of this episode. Frequent and consistent
feedback is necessary to promote any change.</li>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/radiolab.png" width="200">
One of the pioneers in story-telling podcasts. I&rsquo;ve been away from it for a while and have re-subscribed as I&rsquo;ve been
missing the excellent stories.</p>

<p><strong>Favourites:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/91500-emergence/">Emergence</a> &ndash; This episode is from 2007 and it still comes up as one
of the more influencial podcast episodes I&rsquo;ve listened to. I&rsquo;m a control freak and find the concept of emergence hard
to understand. A top-down controller is easier for me to understand. This episode reminds me to rethink how things
ought to be and be more flexible.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/sysk.jpg" width="200">
An exceptional podcast hosted by two charismatic people. Normally I find tangents in podcasts to be distracting, but for
some reason these two often make it worthwhile. They cover a myriad of topics and they make the most mundane seem
fascinating. There are many excellent episodes but the following ones really stood out for me.</p>

<p><strong>Favourites:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The two part series (<a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/the-dark-origins-of-fairy-tales.htm">episode 1</a> <a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-grimms-fairy-tales-work.htm">episode 2</a>) is a wonderful explanation of the origins of fairy tales
and how dark the originally were. The Juniper Tree one is quite horrifying.</li>
<li>Another two part series one <a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/josh-and-chuck-make-it-through-male-puberty.htm">male puberty</a> and <a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/chuck-and-josh-make-it-through-female-puberty.htm">female puberty</a> discusses the awkward
phase of life that we all had with great clarity.</li>

<h2>Music</h2>

<h3><a href="http://music.cbc.ca/radio3/">CBC Radio 3</a><a href="http://www.cbcradio3.com/podcast/"><img src="http://scottmuc.com/images/feed-icon-28x28.png" class="podcast-image" /></a></h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/cbcradio3.jpg" width="200">
It&rsquo;s likely that I&rsquo;m a bit biased, but this is where I discover new music. I worked
there from 2005-2009 during the rise of the podcast. I can attest to the quality of the curation of the content coming
from the folks at Radio 3. The superfeed subscribes you to all the different podcasts published by Radio 3, though I
don&rsquo;t think there are as many shows as there used to be.</p>

<h3><a href="http://songexploder.net/">Song Exploder</a><a href="http://songexploder.libsyn.com/rss"><img src="http://scottmuc.com/images/feed-icon-28x28.png" class="podcast-image" /></a></h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/songexploder.png" width="200">
This show satifies my curiosity about how a song gets made. It also makes me
appreciate songs that I wouldn&rsquo;t have given a second listen. By listening to this show, you can disover new artists, and
you&rsquo;ll learn how to listen to music and grow appreciation for the more subtle elements of song composition.</p>

<hr />

<h3><a href="http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510019/all-songs-considered">All Songs Considered</a><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rss/podcast.php?id=510019"><img src="http://scottmuc.com/images/feed-icon-28x28.png" class="podcast-image" /></a></h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/npr-asc.jpg" width="200">
A podcast I tend to listen to when I going to sleep. I don&rsquo;t quite keep up with music as much as I should, but I find
listening to this keeps me somewhat informed of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<h2>Language</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.theallusionist.org/">The Allusionist</a><a href="http://feeds.theallusionist.org/Allusionist"><img src="http://scottmuc.com/images/feed-icon-28x28.png" class="podcast-image" /></a></h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/allusionist.png" width="200">
I could list to Helen Zaltzman speak all day. Her style and sense of humour is wonderful and I find that I learn a lot
about the origins of the words in my native language.</p>

<p><strong>Favourites:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/please">Please</a> &ndash; Listen to this episode and think again if someone from another culture is being rude.
Also, think about how other cultures may have perceived you as being rude by trying to be overly polite!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/wltm-i">WLTM</a> &ndash; The language surrounding dating from three hundred years ago.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>There are a lot of podcasts here and I&rsquo;m constantly re-evaluating which ones should remain. Finding the balance of time
and value is hard to figure out. Currently I&rsquo;m unemployed making it a lot easier to consume this much content. I also
listen to tech specific podcasts when I&rsquo;m spending some time in that technology. A good example of that would be the
<a href="http://rubyrogues.com/">ruby rogues</a> podcast. Or, I may take a look at <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/">HanselMinutes</a> to see if something
interesting has come up.</p>

<p>To subscribe to all the same podcasts that I do, import this <a href="/podcasts_opml.xml">OPML</a> file into your favourite podcast
listening software.</p>

<h2>Unsubcribed</h2>

<p>After a while I find myself changing my podcast listening tastes. Rather than delete them from this post, I&rsquo;ll list
them here and provide some context as to why I don&rsquo;t listen to them anymore.</p>

<h3><a href="http://a16z.com/tag/podcast/">a16z</a><a href="http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:62921190/sounds.rss"><img src="http://scottmuc.com/images/feed-icon-28x28.png" class="podcast-image" /></a></h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/a16z.jpg" width="200">
Getting into the startup world is not something I&rsquo;m terribly interested in, but I am critical
about the tech community, especially startups. This show helps me better understand the world of startups so I can
better understand the mechanics of startups. Over time this podcast has become to irritate me. The Valley speak gets to
you after a while (count how many questions are answered with an excited &ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;). I stopped listen to this
because I realized that I simply did not care about the startup world. Listening to this podcast started to depress me.</p>

<p><strong>Favourites:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://a16z.com/2014/09/05/a16z-podcast-everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazon/">Everything You Need to Know About Amazon</a> &ndash; Explanation of how Amazon re-invests all of its profits to avoid
opportunity costs is a novel concept. Not sure why investors are ok with it. Makes me more curious about what Amazon
will be doing 20-30 years from now.</li>
<li><a href="http://a16z.com/2014/09/30/a16z-podcast-creating-new-silicon-valleys/">Creating New Silicon Valleys</a> &ndash; When something becomes trendy, people always want to figure out how
to replicate it. This episode explains how cultures are emergent, not created. Common sense it would seem, but that
doesn&rsquo;t seem to really stop people. I feel the same around the topic of <a href="/valuable-links-devops/">DevOps</a>.</li>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/startup.png" width="200">
A podcast about a podcast startup. It mixes so many of my favourite things into one show.
Fantastic storytelling about a medium I&rsquo;m passionate about and a domain that I want to learn more of. What connects
me to the show is that <a href="https://twitter.com/abexlumberg">Alex Blumberg</a> just wants to work on something he&rsquo;s passionate about, but has to wade through all
sorts of concerns completely separate from what he really wants to do, because that&rsquo;s business. Though this podcast
didn&rsquo;t depress me like the a16z podcast did, I found the material getting pretty old. It was starting to repeat many of
the lessons from the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/podcast-1/">StackOverflow Podcast</a> (from 2008). Also, more North American podcast content isn&rsquo;t
something I really want more of.</p>

<p><strong>Favourites:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://hearstartup.com/episodes/gbm3498ruf7abd4owt4xs20uck1cvn">Startups are Risky Business</a> &ndash; This gave me insight around the different VC models. I used to think
that they are all looking for the 100x payoff. I need to learn more about the more modest investments out there.
Sometimes you can invest in something simply because you want it to exist.</li>

Not quite a technical podcast, but it shares stories from the software development world. I became a fan of
<a href="https://twitter.com/r00k">Ben Orenstein</a> when I saw him do a play-by-play screencast. He strikes me as someone I would enjoy

This one is fairly new and I&rsquo;ve already become a fan. <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishunt">Chris Hunt</a>
delivers his show in a charming style. He discusses being healthy, and what&rsquo;s interesting in the software world. All to
the tune of a catchy theme song. Now I just need to get into the habit of doing the workout of the week. Removed for now
because of its technical base.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/podcasts/ted-radio-hour.jpg" width="200">
Episodes are themed around TED talks of similar topics. It blends interviews with the speakers along with their talks.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/03/28/175609678/the-violence-within-us?showDate=2014-08-08">The Violence Within Us</a> &ndash; Sort of a scary episode, but it helps me understand that life is always in a

provides a good dose of reality.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/321797073/what-is-original?showDate=2014-06-27">What is Original</a> &ndash; The thought of being unique and interesting is something everyone craves, but in the

Getting into the spiritual side a bit. This show talks about culture and religion with an
open mind. The show reminds me to appreciate the differences between all of us on this rock. I used to listen to this

minimaly applying &ldquo;Code Blue&rdquo; protocols when they know the patient won&rsquo;t survive or will survive at a considerable

A show about curious events. They did a neat thing where they perform a lateral thinking puzzle with each episode. It

Most of the time I dislike drawn out conversational style podcasts but this one I enjoy listening to while doing tasks
(and I don&rsquo;t mind not absorbing the contents of the episode). The hosts are: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGP_Grey">CGP Grey</a>, who entertains me with
his affinity for comfort and observing the world from a far. Often I find myself aligned with his views and enjoy his
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w">Youtube Channel</a> immensely. The other host is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran">Brady Haran</a> who is energetic and curious. I
enjoy is enthusiasm around travel. I would love to have beer with these two which I know Grey would despise the idea and
Brady would love it. Their contrasting personalities and mutual respect for each other is why I&rsquo;ll stick with this
podcast even though the episodes are too long by my listening standards.</p>

This show takes a deeper look around statistics. It does the deeper critical view so you don&rsquo;t have to. Listening to
this makes me trust reports even less. Spin is such a problem and how information is presented requires a lot of effort
to reveal a non-biased presentation.</p>

For once it&rsquo;s nice to listen to something that isn&rsquo;t about US politics. I started listening to economic podcasts to
understand more of the world around me. Now it&rsquo;s pointing me in the direction of politics. This show is interesting to
hear about how ideas and policies gets introduced to society. They tackle some difficult issues as well which makes it a
bit heavier than some of the other lighter podcasts I have listed here.</p>
