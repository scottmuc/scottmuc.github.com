<h3>Hungary for More (Siófok/Tihany)</h3>

<p>Remember the woman that I met at the <a href="/prague-budapest-and-the-hungarian-grand-prix/">Dream Theater concert</a>? We have kept in touch and she promised to show me around the
Hungarian country side! She recommended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Balaton">Balaton Lake</a> area so I found a <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2522686">place to stay</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si%C3%B3fok">Siófok</a> and worked
on scheduling a day to meet up.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the weather did not cooperate as it rained most of the time I was there. On the plus side, I picked up a
cold on my way from Ukraine and wasn&rsquo;t feeling very adventurous anyways. I spent 3 days enjoying the sound of the rain,
and watching all of the Harry Potter movies. I picked up some groceries the day I arrived and was able to be pretty
self-sufficient.</p>

<p>On the last day my cold was disappearing and the weather outlook was brighter. Just in time for my meet up with <strong>Orsolya</strong> and a tour of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veszpr%C3%A9m">Veszprém</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihany">Tihany</a>. Both places had the European charm that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed so much on this trip.
The sun came out while walking around Inner Lake (pic 3 below). <strong>Orsolya</strong> explained what life is like in rural Hungary
and I shared stories of my life. My favourite question was when she asked how I planned my travels. I never really
thought about it, but I replied saying that it was just a combination of many little trips. With each little trip I had
to plan the transition to the next trip and the opened up opportunities for other little trips.</p>

<p>After the day I was feeling recovered from my cold, and happy to have a new friend. Then I headed back to Budapest to
catch a flight to Milano for the last F1 in my travels.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Italian Grand Prix (Milano)</h3>

<p>Figured that I could fit one more F1 race in this trip! I used some points to get a <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/milit-milan-marriott-hotel/">free hotel</a> in Milano. The
commute to the race track is pretty long so I didn&rsquo;t really have much time to explore the city. <a href="https://twitter.com/sragu">Srini</a>, who went
to the <a href="/belgium-france-london-and-the-british-grand-prix/">British GP</a> with me, got his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area#Schengen_visa">Shengen visa</a> and was finally able to explore outside
of Istanbul and the UK. He couldn&rsquo;t come to the race but we got to hang out in the evenings when our respective daily
activities were done.</p>

<p>At the race track there&rsquo;s an abundance of people playing versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_game">shell game</a> . I watched it for
a bit and thought it looked pretty easy. I played once and was absolutely sure of my pick and lost 50 euros. I realized
I got scammed and was initially upset. Then I realized why I played the game. I wanted to win some easy money; how was I
any different than the perpetrators of the scam? It reminded me that no matter how &ldquo;good&rdquo; you try to be, temptation is
always there. I thought I could win a quick buck and I was being just as greedy as the scam artists. I laugh at the
experience now, and see it as a valuable lesson. I spent some time watching these games and saw all the tricks they play
and now understand why it&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;confidence game&rdquo;. I could see ways to &ldquo;win&rdquo;, but I would be playing against a
person who plays for hours everyday. I think their confidence will win in the long run.</p>

<p>As I alluded to earlier, the commute to my seat was quite long. My record time to my seat was 1 hour and 40 minutes, but
it was 2 hours most of the time. One of the nice things about F1 is that they aren&rsquo;t too strict about what you can bring
to the track. Each day I bought food from a local grocery store. Below is a picture of my breakfast on race day (yes
beer at 9:00am, don&rsquo;t judge). Buying from the on track vendors is a complete rip-off. For the price of a couple beers, I
was stocked up for the day.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/milano-breakfast.jpg"><img class="center" src="/images/blog/career-break/milano-breakfast.medium.jpg" width="700"></a></p>

<p>As for the race, the weekend was full of awesome moments. I watched both GP2 and GP3 races, and the F1 race was full of
awesome passes. I was sitting at the first turn which is at the end of a very fast straight (<a href="http://www.formula1.com/races/in_detail/italy_928/circuit_diagram.html">circuit diagram</a>).
Hopefully this historic track doesn&rsquo;t close, but I am so happy that I got to experience Monza before anything happens to
the event.</p>

<p>Of course my travels wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without meeting up with <a href="https://twitter.com/iliasbartolini">Ilias Bartolini</a>, a ThoughtWorker I met when I
was in India. He&rsquo;s on a project in Milano and we caught up over dinner at <a href="http://www.pizzeriamaruzzellamilano.it/">Maruzzella</a>. Again, a reminder of the
network that grew out of working at ThoughtWorks is global and full of such wonderful people.</p>

<h3>Turkish Delight</h3>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-view.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-view.small.jpg" width="300"></a>
The last leg of my European travels is a stay in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul">Istanbul</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsQrKZcYtqg">not Constantinople</a>). There&rsquo;s a big ThoughtWorks
project there and was able to stay in <a href="https://twitter.com/sragu">Srini</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/noppanit">Toy&rsquo;s</a> apartment (picture of the view to the right).
I wasn&rsquo;t sure how long I was going to be there so it was nice to have the flexibility of a ThoughtWorker&rsquo;s accommodation.</p>

<p>The reason for the uncertain length is that I would be applying for my <a href="http://indianvisaonline.gov.in/">Indian visa</a> from here. I won&rsquo;t go
into too much detail, but the process was relatively painless. The website is horrible and doesn&rsquo;t work in all browsers,
but once I got my application submitted, the rest of the process was straightforward. In a little over a week I got my
visa.</p>

<p>At this point in time I was beginning the interview process for several organizations. Much of my time was spent doing
coding exercises and submitting them, or doing calls. I really felt things were going forward and that in some time I&rsquo;ll
actually have figured out where I&rsquo;ll be living after all of this traveling.</p>

<p>It was a bit of a mini reunion with several people too. I met up with <a href="http://davidpetersimon.com/">David Simon</a>, who I climbed Kilimanjaro
with. There was also a bit of a Calgary reunion where I met up with <a href="http://isa.io/">Isa Goksu</a> who was my roommate for
over a year and I probably hadn&rsquo;t seem him in over 2 years! When I met up with Isa, <a href="http://www.cengizhan.com/">Cengiz Han</a>
was also there, smoking sheesha. He too was in Calgary, usually complaining about the cold, yet both of them talked
about how much they miss the Calgary days.</p>

<p>Oh right, I&rsquo;m in Istanbul! In the slack time, I spent many days wandering around this incredible city. My friend
<strong>Rose</strong> has a <a href="http://adidav9.blogspot.in/2014/07/illustrious-istanbul.html">picture filled post</a> that better captures the beauty of the city (and of other European
cities I&rsquo;ve visited).</p>

<p>Most of my day trips started out at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_Square">Taksim Square</a>, which was the space that the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22732139">Gezi Park Riots</a> took
place at in 2013. Taking the metro from where I was staying was easy and efficient. From there I went down <a href="http://istiklalstreet.org/">Istiklal Street</a>
which is a big shopping area. My first stop was <a href="http://istanbuleats.com/2009/04/durumzade-wrap-artists/">Dürümzade</a> which was made famous by <strong>Anthony Bordain&rsquo;s</strong>
visit. Let&rsquo;s just say I went there 3 times during my stay! The adana dürüm was one of my favourite meals in Istanbul.
The area is a maze of winding hilly streets and I was content to wander this part of the city for a long time. Some days
I would hangout at <a href="http://kronotrop.com.tr/">Kronotrop</a> which is an excellent coffee bar. There&rsquo;s wifi and friendly people who are
very open to helping out a tourist with their Turkish. The pictures below are of: Istiklal Street, small street leading
to Dürümzade, and outside of Dürümzade.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-large-street.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-large-street.small.jpg" width="385"></a>
<a href="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-small-street.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-small-street.small.jpg" width="224"></a>
<a href="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-durumzade.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-durumzade.small.jpg" width="385"></a></p>

<p>On another day I walk down further and crossed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galata_Bridge">Galata Bridge</a> and navigated through all the
fishermen to the other side (pic 1 below, you can see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galata_Tower">Galata Tower</a> in the background). Once on Old
Istanbul side I follow the meandering alleys in the direction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> (pic 2 below). How I arrive there I
don&rsquo;t know because the roads go in many different directions and they are very crowded. I kept on having to back track
as I took many wrong turns. It was a lot of fun to be lost in the shuffle. Unfortunately I arrived there after the
museum was closed so I didn&rsquo;t get to see inside. Last destination was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Ahmed_Mosque">Blue Mosque</a> which is probably
one of the most famous landmarks (hard to say because there are so many). I was lucky to arrive in between prayer times
and was able to go inside. It was so majestic on the inside that I believe I sat there for at least 45 minutes just
soaking in the atmosphere. I couldn&rsquo;t get a decent picture inside with my phone (which has been my only camera on this
trip). I did manage to get a decent snap as the sun was getting low on the horizon (pic 3 below).</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-fishing.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-fishing.small.jpg" width="330"></a>
<a href="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-hagia-sophia.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-hagia-sophia.small.jpg" width="330"></a>
<a href="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-blue-mosque.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/istanbul-blue-mosque.small.jpg" width="330"></a></p>

<p>One day walking around beautiful Old Istanbul wasn&rsquo;t enough so I made another walking tour from Taksim Square. This
time, instead of going east to all the great mosques and monuments I kept on going South to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Bazaar,_Istanbul">Grand Bazaar</a>.
Walking through the bazaar is like being transported in time. I used to think India was a sensory explosion, but this
place comes pretty close. It was also a &lsquo;90s time warp as I couldn&rsquo;t get the following song out of my head:</p>

<div style="width:660px;margin-left:200px;">
<iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JCye7v79Tz0 " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>Never have I felt so immersed in history. I&rsquo;ve seen some historic places in my travels. The throngs of people that
still populate these places made the history feel more alive. At some point I&rsquo;ll have to go back to Turkey when I&rsquo;m not
quite so traveled out and explore more of the countries beauty and friendly people.</p>

<h3>Onward to India</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for my travels in Europe for nearly 3 months. I now have the idea of writing a post about the metrics of this
career break. It&rsquo;ll be a good way to close out the series. But not yet! Now off to India for a few months to hang out
with friends, and get re-invigorated about software development.</p>

<h3>Ukraine</h3>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-train.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-train.small.jpg" width="300"></a>
The next leg of the journey was a long slog from Vienna to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv">L’viv</a>. I took a noon train to Budapest and had to pass
some time there for a little while. From Budapest it was an overnight journey with many frequent stops in the
middle of the night for immigration and customs. If you’ve ever played <a href="http://papersplea.se/">Papers, Please</a>, it felt like that. Ukraine
isn’t part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement">Schengen agreement</a> so you can’t just cross the border without a documents check. Around a few
hours from L’viv the attendant asks me about my purpose in Ukraine. She then points at my &ldquo;ringless&rdquo; ring finger and
smiles. I knew of the Russian/Ukrainian bride thing, but found it crazy that her first guess was for that purpose.
I thought it was a hyped up, but after watching a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wW7c58nMI4">youtube documentaries</a> about it, I learned
it’s sadly alive and well.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-train2.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-train2.small.jpg" width="300"></a>
Even with such a long journey the train pretty much arrived on time within a couple minutes. When I exited the train I
immediately could recognize my cousin <a href="https://twitter.com/RusalkaUA">Lilia</a>. She ran up to me and gave me a proper family style hug. Looks like I’m
home! We took a bus to her home in the Northern part of the city. I was introduced to her roommate,
<a href="https://twitter.com/uPadavan">Vitalik</a>. He and I got along really well. He’s a web designer and looks to have a knack for it!
Lilia had to go back to work so I unpacked and made myself at home. Later that evening Lilia’s sister, Natalia, arrived
by train from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternopil">Ternopil</a>. She had a huge package of food from her parents and we all enjoyed a feast as I
did my best to tell the story of myself and the Myц family Canadian history.</p>

<h2>L'viv</h2>

<p>I felt immediately comfortable in L’viv. As Lilia was at work, Vitalik and Natalia guided me around the city. Here
are some of the noteworthy places we checked out:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-high-castle.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-high-castle.small.jpg" width="190" title="&ldquo;High Castle&rdquo;" ></a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv_High_Castle">High Castle</a> &ndash; On my first day in L'viv I was antsy to go out and explore. I never feel comfortable
  in a location until I spend at least a whole day walking around exploring and knowing my surroundings. Natalia likes
  to sleep in (she&rsquo;s going to kill me), so instead of waiting for her to wake up, I decide to explore L'viv on my own.
  The high castle name is more of a memory as the castle isn&rsquo;t there anymore. Getting to the top of the hill was
  good exercise and rewarded me with a beautiful 360 degree view of the city.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-dim-legend.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-dim-legend.small.jpg" width="190" title="&ldquo;Dim Legend&rdquo;" ></a>
<a href="http://ukraineallaboutu.com/travel-in-ukraine/hotels-and-restaurants/lviv/house-of-legends/">Dim Legend (House of Legend)</a> &ndash; There are a collection of restaurants owned by a company that&rsquo;s doing some interesting
  setups. Dim Legend has a room for every story (or a story for every room). The restaurant takes
  the entire building and you can go up to the roof top where there&rsquo;s patio with a car, and a chimney with a ladder so
  that you can climb to the top. There&rsquo;s something refreshing about being in a country that doesn&rsquo;t have the same
  restrictive safety regulations of most western countries.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-rynok.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-rynok.small.jpg" width="190" title="&ldquo;Rynok Square&rdquo;" ></a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Square_(Lviv)">Rynok Square</a> &ndash; Like most Eastern European cities, L'viv has a beautiful (albeit touristy) city
  square. You&rsquo;ll find the &ldquo;floating&rdquo; statue people and dudes making giant bubbles. Overall though, the atmosphere is
  quaint and relaxing. Ukrainian culture is inviting so it&rsquo;s pretty hard to feel like you&rsquo;re too far out of place.
  This is probably where I spent the most time as all the coffee shops and restaurants are all near this location.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-chocolate-chili.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-chocolate-chili.small.jpg" width="190" title="&ldquo;Melted Chocolate with Chili&rdquo;" ></a>
<a href="http://ukraineallaboutu.com/travel-in-ukraine/hotels-and-restaurants/lviv/lviv-handmade-chocolate/">Lviv chocolate</a> &ndash; One of the most unique experiences I had in L'viv was drinking melted chocolate
  flavoured with a whole whack load of chili powder! This place was not good for any thought about losing weight. Not
  sure how everyone here stays so fit! At least I was getting a lot of walking in, but not sure if it&rsquo;s enough for
  all the sweets I&rsquo;ve been having.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lvivbeermuseum.com/uk/muzey">Lviv brewery</a> &ndash; On my own I stopped by the brewpub to sample a few of their beers. I was really
intrigued by the style of beer they make there. In general, I found Ukrainian beer sweeter than most beers I&rsquo;ve
had around the world. I visited the brewery a second time with Natalia and Vitalik. We took a brewery tour but
it was done in Ukrainian. I&rsquo;ve never heard Ukrainian spoken so fast, but it was pretty comprehensive. She started
the tour talking about the origins of beer in Egypt.</li>
<li><a href="http://trumitlu.virtual.ua/?lang=en">Try Mitly (3 Brooms)</a> &ndash; My cousins are huge Harry Potter fans and they said that there&rsquo;s a place to have
butter beer in L'viv! A lot of places were kitschy but that didn&rsquo;t bother me in this environment. I found them a lot
of fun. It could be that I felt like I was in an environment where people aren&rsquo;t as judgemental about such kinds
of establishments.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.justlviv.it/en/1714/gas-lamp.html">Gas lamp</a> &ndash; Owned by the same person as Dim Legend, this restaurant had a unique feel for every floor
and was a fun environment to take some time and relax in.</li>
<li><a href="http://visittoukraine.com/en/unique-ukraine/lviv-coffee-mine">Lviv coffee manufacture</a> &ndash; L'viv is the coffee capital of Ukraine. Normally tea is the hot beverage
choice, but here coffee rules. A proper L'viv coffee is hot water mixed with the coffee grounds without a filter.
You wait a few minutes and the grounds settle to the bottom and you&rsquo;re left with a rich, flavourful cup of coffee.
The best part is that you don&rsquo;t need any fancy expensive equipment to make it! It&rsquo;s really the quality of the beans
that matter.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychakiv_Cemetery">Lychakiv Cemetery</a> &ndash; I wanted to go somewhere outside the center and old gothic cemeteries seem to appeal
to me for some reason. The day that I visited Lychakiv Cemetery was sunny and warm. The whole area is like a maze and
it was nice to wander around witnessing the beautiful scenery.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/lviv-tram.jpg" width="70">
L'viv is a city rich in culture, architecture, and friendly people. It&rsquo;s accessible with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trams_in_Lviv">120 year old tram</a>
system, but remember to punch your ticket yourself (pictures to the left) and has all the things you need as a traveler.
The city is sort of a dream land for me. It has excellent beer, chocolate, coffee, books, and food. The people are
friendly and accomodating, I can&rsquo;t wait to be back!</p>

<h2>Ternopil</h2>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/ternopil-home.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/ternopil-home.small.jpg" width="200"></a>
For the weekend, Lillia had planned a trip to Ternopil to visit her parents and other relatives. Apparently they don’t
get many foreigners on the train and the attendant on the train made an effort to ask if I wanted tea or coffee in
English. He sort of chuckled and so did my cousins, not sure why. We took a bus from the train station to the outer area of Ternopil
where Lilias’s parents live. It was a classic pre 90’s looking apartment block. The door opens to their apartment and
I’m welcomed with a feast on the table! Lilia’s parents didn’t speak much English so poor Lilia had to spend a lot of
time translating (she eventually could tell me whole life story without me having to say a word). The meal started with
a shot of vodka. When Ivan offered me another, I replied “tak, bud laska!” (translation: yes, please!). That moment
signified me as an authentic family member.</p>

<p>First, I need to digress and talk about Lilia and Natalia’s parents, Ivan and Mariia. They are the sweetest couple and
so generous. I loved how they didn’t let the language barrier prevent us from getting to know each other. One of my
favourite moments was sitting with Ivan as he showed me pictures and we had a conversation. Lilia was busy packing
for the trip back and after she was done she asked what the heck we could possibly talk about. I’m not quite sure
myself, but we laughed a lot and didn’t let language stop us from at least trying to communicate. We even enjoyed
watching the Belgian GP (and what an awesome race!) with some Ukrainian craft beers. One day I hope to learn more
Ukrainian so we can communicate even more the next time we meet.</p>

<p>Mariia could easily be mistaken as a sister of her daughters. She’s actually my
cousin (Lilia and Natalia are my 2nd cousins 1st removed) and the family bond was definitely felt. She’s also an
amazing cook! The meals included home made: cabbage rolls, varenyky (perogies), shkvarky (pork rind), sour cream, borscht, milk, and juice.
I’m pretty sure I gained 5 kilos over those few days.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/ternopil-beer1.jpg" width="180">
<img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/ternopil-beer2.jpg" width="180">
The next day was spent driving to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velyki_Birky">Velyki Birky</a>, a village outside of Ternopil. Our first stop was at Mariia’s parents (Hanna and
Fedoz). First we stopped by a house which was a family run brewery (business card pictured). One of the sons of the owner was there and he
happily (in excellent English) explained the whole operation. The beer was fresh, un-pasterized, un-filtered, and
very tasty. We then arrived and had a big family lunch (with more shots of vodka). Hanna is my dad’s cousin as she
is the daughter of Eve Myц who is the sister of Petro Myц, my dad’s father. The meal was of course fantastic and I
did my best to update them on my family back in Canada. During the afternoon, Lilia, Natalia, and I walked over to
where Hanna&rsquo;s other children live. Lilia gave her best rendition of my life story and we had fun playing more Q&amp;A
with more of my family. One of the big questions was on how Canada was receiving the news about the events going
on in Ukraine. Unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t quite adequatley answer the question but from a generalized perspective I
could say that the West has been pretty weak in it&rsquo;s response.</p>

<p>In the evening I went out with the girls to meet up with some of their friends. It was fun introducing them to some
of the games I played at TWU (eg: numbers game, and one-up one-down). The next day was a holiday for independence day
so we went walking around the city for a bit. The city had some very pretty areas and some interesting looking playgrounds.
After our walk we went to the train station (pic: don&rsquo;t we look like an intimidating group?).</p>

<h2>Back to L'viv</h2>

<p>After an amazing weekend we headed back to L'viv. Lilia&rsquo;s roommate was returning so I had find a <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/451524">place of my own</a>
to for a few days. I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for how much I would miss being in the same place as my cousins and Vitalik (I&rsquo;m
considering him family). I did feel some sense of relief to give Lilia some time without having to worry
about entertaining me and it gave me a chance to practice my Ukrainian all on my own. The few days I spent on my
own was focused on hanging out in coffee shops and working on a browser plugin. I realized there&rsquo;s a reason why
people smiled when I asked for the wifi password when I hung out at a venue. Trying to be Ukrainian I would say
&ldquo;Internet bud laska&rdquo;. This is the equivalent of ordering the Internet off of a menu. My cousins got a good laugh
from this, and apparently so did all the wait staff I said this to.</p>

<p>Anyways, over a couple days I got the the basic functionality of a plugin working called <a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/blockworthy">BlockWorthy</a>.
It scrubs links to viral websites and issues you a warning if you happen to go to one of those websites. It felt good
to be writing some code and exploring some ideas.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Leaving Ukraine I thought about the bond of family. I had been watching Game of Thrones and seeing how important
bloodlines are in that show probably had some affect on me. I was really touched that my cousins would openly accept
me into their home and all because we share common ancestry (my great grandfater, their great great grandfather).
I didn’t even know who were my cousins were until my aunt
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biggar,_Saskatchewan">Biggar</a> informed me there are relatives in Ukraine who would love to meet me. The thought about the subconscious
bond with family made me think about why we have countries and lines on maps. It’s like a higher level view of the
bond. Patriotism is like a larger version of nepotism. I can’t help connect more easily with someone from Canada than
I would USA. My bond with my cousins exists because of who my parents are. My ability to nearly walk into any country
is simply because of the country I was born in.</p>

<p>What I’m really trying to say is that I’m so freaking lucky to be born into an awesome family and country. Because
of these uncontrollable events (on my part), I’ve been afforded so many luxuries.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>July 30th &ndash; August 17th</em></p>

<h2>When in Rome</h2>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/rome-fountain.jpg"><img class="center" src="/images/blog/career-break/rome-fountain.medium.jpg" width="900"></a></p>

<p>When I learned that my uncle and his family would be in Rome I looked at my schedule to see if I could make seeing them
work. It turned out it fit perfectly! The last time I saw them was in London while they were doing their 2013 summer
trip and I was on my Belgian Grand Prix vacation. My aunt and uncle are well versed in the world of business so we had
many evenings discussing what I&rsquo;ve learned from the economics courses and floating ideas of what&rsquo;s next for my life. Of
course I got to catch up with my cousins too. Can&rsquo;t believe how quickly they are growing up (I won&rsquo;t mention that I
remember seeing them in diapers to avoid their embarassment).  They had rented a flat near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Steps">Spanish Steps</a>
which made it easy for me to cram in a bunch of sight-seeing in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Touring Rome is pretty easy because all you have to do is step outside. Even on my first walk I stumbled across many
interersting sites. I did a couple free walking tours, but they weren&rsquo;t organized by Sandeman and weren&rsquo;t nearly the
same quality. Still, it was good to have a guided walk to the Colloseum and to the Vatican. My favourite place was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gallery_of_Maps">Hallway of Maps</a> in the Vatican Museum. Ever since I was a kid, I&rsquo;ve always loved looking at maps. On
roadtrips I would be the navigator, and my favourite thing about Ultima VII is the cloth map that was packaged with the
game</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/rome-colosseum.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/rome-colosseum.small.jpg" width="335"></a>

<a href="/images/blog/career-break/rome-st-peters.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/rome-st-peters.small.jpg" width="335"></a></p>

<p>As beautiful as Rome was, I knew my time as a tourist was ending. I was at the point where I didn&rsquo;t want to elbow my
way through tourists anymore. Nor was I as interested as I was before in exploring musuems and historical places. The
brain can only hold so much. One thing I enjoyed immensely were the flavour of the tomatoes! Every meal I had I was sure
to have tomatoes as a part of it.</p>

<h2>Watching Time Go By in Switzerland</h2>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-home.jpg"><img class="center" src="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-home.medium.jpg" width="900"></a></p>

<p>The other part that made Rome convenient was that I could travel to Switzerland to meet up with fellow ex-ThoughtWork
<a href="https://twitter.com/mhoefi">Marc Hofer</a>, who I worked with in India in ThoughtWorks University (TWU), and who&rsquo;s balcony view is displayed above.
He had a 1L bottle of scotch ready (we numbed our heads with scotch nearly every evening during TWU). Thankfully he was
generous enough to give me a couch for as long as I needed one. I ended up spending 10 days in beautiful <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/thun.html">Thun</a>!</p>

<p>Over the those days I did the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dinners and chats with Marc</strong> &ndash; Catching up with Marc was a lot of fun. During the day I would accrue a lot of ideas and
he became my wall to bounce them off of. One such idea was my new currency that I called &ldquo;Sunset&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a time based
currency where you determine the exchange rate of the base amount which is a Day. If your daily expenses are $100USD,
then that&rsquo;s the exchange rate into Days. If you have $1400 in the bank than you have 2 Weeks saved. It&rsquo;s a completely
personal currency because everyone&rsquo;s exchange into Days will be different. We of course
talked about our time in India and software development in Switzerland. We never really lacked of things to talk about
the whole time I was there.</li>
<li><a href="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-bern.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-bern.small.jpg" width="300"></a> <strong>Bern
Excursion</strong> &ndash; Marc had a meetup with some of his colleagues and invited me out. I took a train out to Bern a few
hours before the meetup started so I could wander around a bit. It didn&rsquo;t take long for me to find the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindlifresserbrunnen">Kindlifresserbrunnen (Child Eater Fountain)</a> which is probably the most bizarre statue I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The old
town was beautiful (like Antwerp, Bruges, Heidelberg, Prague, etc&hellip;) and of course I found a nearby
<a href="http://www.altestramdepot.ch/htm/home.htm">brewery</a> to quench my thirst for a bit before heading to meet up with Marc and his colleagues.</li>
<li><strong>Coffee shops</strong> &ndash; During the day I looked to find cafes to hang out in and work on my blog (these posts seem to take me a
heck of a lot of time). There was <a href="https://plus.google.com/106555922181396502598/about?hl=en">one cafe</a> that I really liked. The staff were friendly, played good music, and the
coffee and beers available were very tasty. During this period I was getting working on my <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/scottmuc">CV</a> and getting
excited about working again!</li>
<li><a href="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-bike.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-bike.small.jpg" width="300"></a> <strong>Bike
around Lake Thun</strong> &ndash; The weather was hit-and-miss, but for one day there was excellent weather. I rented a bike and
rode it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlaken">Interlaken</a> and back to Thun for a total of 60km. It was a beautiful ride, but I could feel that I&rsquo;m a bit
out of shape.</li>
<li><strong>Train tour</strong> &ndash; There were spare days on my Eurail pass so I decided to check out all the main city centers in the
country. I started by going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva">Geneva</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich">Zurich</a>, and finished in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucerne">Luzern</a>.
Mike Wong, a ThoughtWorker from SF, was on vacation and we met up for dinner. Seriously, ThoughtWorkers are everywhere!</li>
<li><strong>Oberhofen Castle and Clock Museum</strong> &ndash; Over the weekend Marc played tourist with me and we headed over to Oberhofen. The
purpose of the trip was to go the <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/museum-of-clocks-and-mechanical-musical-instruments.html">clock museum</a> but it didn&rsquo;t open for a few hours. We walked around and decided to
tour the <a href="http://www.schlossoberhofen.ch/en/home">castle</a>. After a bit of walking and a quick snack we went back to the clock museum. They
didn&rsquo;t do tours in English so Marc played translator. Even in Swiss-German it was a fun tour. The guide was clearly
passionate about the watches and the music devices.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-spiez.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-spiez.small.jpg" width="335"></a>

<a href="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-bridge.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-bridge.small.jpg" width="335"></a></p>

<p>Since I was in the land of clocks I was hoping to purchase a watch there. Something to be a symbol of taking time to
enjoy life (a principle of my career break) and something to keep me from looking at my phone for the time. I was
inspired by the intricate work that goes into making a watch and thought having one on my wrist would remind me to take
pride in my work and take the necessary time to do it well. Unfortunately all the watch stores were posh and displayed
ideas around prestige and fashion more than engineering. It switched off my idea of purchasing a watch for now.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-currency.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/swiss-currency.small.jpg" width="180"></a>
It was hard to leave Switzerland because I was growing comfortable there. The people were friendly and forgiving of my
inability to speak any of the 4 official languages. Then again, paying over $30 (0.3 Days) was quickly draining my money
reserves. At least the best part of Switzerland is free; the scenery. Oh, and I also like how the currency folded nicely
in my money clip. The notes are sized in such a way that the denomination of the note aligns in such a way that you can
see all of your notes when folded! I can&rsquo;t say how many times I&rsquo;ve had a roll of US notes and found that they were all
$1 bills and I only had a total of $30 on me.</p>

<h2>Composing my Thoughts in Vienna</h2>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/vienna-cats.jpg"><img class="center" src="/images/blog/career-break/vienna-cats.medium.jpg" width="900"></a></p>

<p>The next leg of my journey is a long train trip to L'viv, Ukraine. I decided to break up the trip with a stop in Vienna
for a couple days. With only a couple days I had to pack in the sight-seeing. This was made easier with me being
museumed-out so I was mostly checking things out from the outside. To make things easy, I found a
<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1531563">great location</a> with a host with a couple cats (pictured above).</p>

<p>My first day was spent checking out the two largest palaces in Vienna. The highlight was a stop at a <a href="http://www.salmbraeu.com/index.php?id=2&amp;L=1">brewery</a> just
outside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvedere_(palace)">Belvedere</a> palace. The service was great, the food yummy, and every beer tasty. After 1.5L of beer I was set
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace">Schönbrunn</a> palace. I took the metro there and climb up the hill to Gloriette and had a little nap on the grass there.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/vienna-belvedere.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/vienna-belvedere.small.jpg" width="335"></a>
<a href="/images/blog/career-break/vienna-schunbrunn.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/vienna-schunbrunn.small.jpg" width="335"></a>
<a href="/images/blog/career-break/vienna-center.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/vienna-center.small.jpg" width="335"></a></p>

<p>The next day I used a city bike rental. I&rsquo;m glad I did because I saw a very different Vienna. First stop was to checkout
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundertwasser_Haus">Hundertwasserhaus</a>. It was so interesting and pretty that I wondered why beautiful buildings
like it had to be the exception to the rule. His <a href="http://www.hundertwasser.com/">website</a> is full of interesting ideas. His 5-skins
concept is one I find myself conflicted about. I wonder what it would have been like to have him and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> had a conversation.</p>

<p>I then went through <a href="http://www.wien-vienna.com/prater.php">Prater</a> which was a scary amusement park. The weather was a bit gloomy and there were some
giant clown shaped buildings that made me think of the book IT.</p>

<p>Since I was on a bike I could cover
a bit more distance so I went towards the bridge and crossed North to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donau_City">Donaucity</a>. It was like riding into a dystopian
story! The streets were stark and there was a cold feeling to the area. I rode away to the nearby park and found it odd
to see such a large expanse of greenery vacant on a Saturday afternoon. It reminded me again that big design up front
for cities does not work. What you end up with is something functional but complete devoid of any human feel. After
riding back to the center I parked the bike at another area and checked out another <a href="http://www.1516brewingcompany.com/cms/">brewery</a>. I think I
went there during shift change because it took a long time to get the attention of a waitress. The beer and the currywurst was really
good, but the poor service at the obnoxious sounding Australian behind me (probably was just my mood) was wearing me
down and I took the metro back to the apartment and hung out in the flat with Roman and his cats.</p>

<p>After one more sleep it&rsquo;s time for me to leave Vienna and head to L'viv, Ukraine!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>July 22nd &ndash; July 29th</em></p>

<h3>Prague</h3>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/prague.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/prague.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<p>Next portion of the trip is to Eastern Europe! I had a nice simple itinerary to Prague: <strong>Heidelberg &ndash;> Munich &ndash;> Prague</strong>.
Unfortunately something was going on with the brakes on the train and I missed my train in Munich so it
turned into: <strong>Heidelberg &ndash;> Munich &ndash;> Neurberg &ndash;> Cheb &ndash;> Prague</strong>. By now I&rsquo;m a seasoned itinerary refactorer so this
didn&rsquo;t phase me. These little <em>adjustments of the universe</em> can sometimes end up with interesting things happening. At
the Plzen stop, a woman sat across from me in the couchette. She started speaking to me in Czech and my response was the
standard Canadian response: I&rsquo;m sorry?</p>

<br />


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo; or &ldquo;sowry&rdquo; in the short form is Canadian for: I apologize that I don&rsquo;t speak your language and I&rsquo;m embarassed to
ask you to repeat yourself in English because I&rsquo;ve never had to deal with speaking and understanding multiple languages. Of course
I&rsquo;m also making the assumption that you can speak English because a world without English is just unfathomable. Again,
I&rsquo;m sorry</p></blockquote>

<p>Then in English she said I looked Czech and was just inquiring about the train. Turns out
she spoke excellent English, lives in San Diego and was just in the country to visit her family. Eventually we
started chit chatting and the conversation about my trip became the focus of interest. I had fun demoing her the <a href="/twinery/independent-accord.html">cargo ship tour</a>
and got some usability feedback as a result. Next thing I knew we were in Prague. Even with my limited
social ability to pick up on body language, I think she was flirting with me! In my usual fashion I dropped the ball. We
parted ways with a handshake and me wishing her a pleasant visit with her family.</p>

<p>After hitting my head against a wall for what seemed like a decade, I continued on to a rendezvous point in the
train station where I was to meet up with <a href="https://twitter.com/nohwnd">Jakub Jareš</a>. He&rsquo;s a core contributor to <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester">Pester</a>,
who in the last 6 months, has taken pretty much all the maintenance burden off of my shoulders. He offered to take me out for beers and I obviously
couldn&rsquo;t resist an offer like that. It was the rainiest day of the summer and he guided me to the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2094840">airbnb</a>
where I was to stay for the next couple days. Then we proceeded to a <a href="http://www.pivovarskyklub.com/">bar</a> (and got soaked in the process). We enjoyed many beers,
discussed much about software development, and my ineptness with the woman on the train was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>Sandeman operates in Prague too so I did a couple tours:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/prague-castle.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/prague-castle.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newpraguetours.com/daily-tours/new-prague-free-tour.html">Free Tour</a>: I can&rsquo;t really talk about this tour without talking about the guide. <a href="http://www.newpraguetours.com/our-guides/pavel.html">Pavel</a>
was quite the character. He had an entertaining dry wit and personalized the tour with stories of his own family. I
was blown away when he said is grandmother has lived in the same flat her whole life and has lived in 9 different
countries as a result. It was a good reminder on the craziness humans have to deal with all the time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newpraguetours.com/daily-tours/prague-castle-tour.html">Castle Tour</a>: Fortunately, Pavel was the guide for this tour too! He sort of stumbled over a
little late and asked the group if we could deviate from the standard tour itinerary and visit a
<a href="http://europeupclose.com/article/st-norberts-brewery-in-prague/">monastery</a> where some award winning beer is brewed. No one was opposed and I got to have a fantastic
beer at the beginning of the tour. The castle was very different than other castles I&rsquo;ve seen. The distictive
feature was the cathedral but the surrounding buildings were much different. At the end of the tour, I really
enjoyed walking through the <a href="http://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/guidepost-for-visitors/gardens-of-the-prague-castle.shtml#a5">garden around the ramparts</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I really enjoyed Prague. You really need to avoid the square as much as possible. Once out of the tourist area,
everything is quite afforable and less hectic. Even though my stay was short, I felt that I got the most out of it. I
would like to go back and explore further and do some hacking with Jakub though.</p>

<h3>Arriving in Budapest</h3>

<p>My stay was short in Prague because I had to get to Budapest for the last of my Grand Prix adventure. Fortunately it was
a direct train! The <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1767274">airbnb</a> was close to the station and was able to take the metro there. I was really happy with the
location, and the host was exceptional in responding to my queries. One interesting thing about taking the train around
Europe is that you start to see patterns in the train stations from different countries. There was quite a difference
between the stations in Czech Republic and Slovakia compared to Germany and Hungary. Now I want to create an archive of
train stations so I can do more comparing and contrasting.</p>

<h3>Hungarian Grand Prix</h3>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/budapest-bags.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/budapest-bags.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<p>Getting to the race track was a fairly painless experience in Budapest. The transit workers were also extremely helpful
and knowledgable about the logistics of the race. The track was located in a beautiful area just outside Budapest. I
spent the Friday walking around the track (in 35C weather). The track area was super clean and I think that&rsquo;s owed to
the fact that bright blue garbage bags were never more than 20ft away from you. Overall, I would say this Grand Prix had
the most pleasant logistics experience. More importantly though, this was an <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/28/race-recap-2014-hungarian-grand-prix-a-thrilling-wet-mess/">incredible race</a>! A cloud burst occured
around 60 minutes before the race began. All the drivers had to change their strategies and start with wet tyres. Then
an accident occured a few laps in that caused some pit lane confusion resulting in the leaders being in the middle of
the pack. Nearly every lap had battles going on from all positions. I think this ranks up there as one of the best races
of the year (Bahrain was pretty close). I&rsquo;m sort of sad that my stream of F1 races is over, but also happy because now
the rest of my time is entirely unscheduled. Who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll do a quick detour to Belgium and go to the race there
at the end of the month.</p>

<br />


<br />


<h3>Dream Theater in Budapest</h3>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/dream-theater.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/dream-theater.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<p>As a bonus I saw posters stating that <a href="http://www.dreamtheater.net/">Dream Theater</a> is playing nearby! I&rsquo;ve been a fan of them since 1998 and have never
seen them live! Everything looked too perfect: the venue was a beautiful tram ride away, it starts after the majority of
the F1 events are done, it ended at a decent hour so I could be rested for race day, and tickets were still available!
After freshening up after another hot day at the track I walk to the tram and arrive at the venue around an hour before
the show starts. I was in line to grab some food when the woman next to me asks me a question in Hungarian. Here we go
again! I respond with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo;. She switches to English and asks if I was
ahead of her. I had no idea, and it didn&rsquo;t really matter to me so I said she was first. As I get my food, she asks where
I&rsquo;m from. I tell her I&rsquo;m going to find some beer and she offers to show me where I can sample some
proper Hungarian liquor. I follow her lead and she orders me palinka which is a fruit brandy. Fortunately I&rsquo;m well
adapted to plum whiskey from hazy memories of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Eb7a8-LvQ">ThoughtBoarder</a> trips (thanks <a href="http://www.yycapps.com/2012/09/developer-interview-radu-muresan/">Radu</a>), so the shot goes down easy. She says
she needs to bring the food back to her group and I bid farewell and find a spot in the crowd to watch the show. Ten or
fifteen minutes pass and she finds me in the crowd. We continue to chat about music, travel and Hungary. It turns out
that her dad brought her to the concert (coolest dad in the world!), and she asked if it was ok to hang out with me
during the show (you had to ask?!). You would think that I would have learned my lesson from my previous female
encounter&hellip; nope. Though I did do a bit better. I wrote down my website and she asked if she could find me on Facebook
(I wasn&rsquo;t sure if my profile was searchable, but I said yes). The show was fantastic and made better by having her company.
I got a message from her a few days later and we&rsquo;re still corresponding! Clearly something supernatural was going on as
you can tell from this image of the show.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/budapest-view.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/budapest-view.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<p>The weather following the race was not so good. I managed to explore a little bit around the vicinity of where I was
staying, but spent most of the time catching up with Coursera. Sandeman did not have any presence in Budapest so I took
a free tour by another organization. I can&rsquo;t say it was up to the same standard, but it was still informative
nevertheless. It ended near the castle and I enjoyed a relatively rain free walk back to my flat and prepared for my
next destination, Rome.</p>

<h3>Reunions in Glasgow</h3>

<p>Since my train didn&rsquo;t leave until after noon, I decided to go back to Bletchley Park and spend the
morning there. It was so nice to just spend some idle time in the park and not hurry through the
exhibits. Unrushed, I made my way to the train station for a direct train to Glasgow.
Upon arrival at the station I was greeted by Derek and <a href="http://adidav9.blogspot.cz/">Rose</a> who I know from back in the Calgary
days. They&rsquo;ve been super generous and hosting me at their apartment which is close to the train station.
It was fun to look back at the tough project we worked on together and look at the experience with
fondness and nostalgia. Rose was my concert buddy and Derek was probably the only person I know
that likes <a href="http://www.sundance.tv/series/greenporno">Green Porno</a> as much as I do.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/glasgow-necropolis.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/glasgow-necropolis.small.jpg" width="300"></a> During my first
day I wandered around the city center and then went up to the <a href="http://www.glasgownecropolis.org/">Necropolis</a>. It was
a beautiful place and had a view over the city. Had I been more prepared I would have spent more time
there in search of graves of noteworthy people. On my walk back to the apartment I saw an e-mail from
the company that chartered my cargo ship cruise. Apparently BBC&rsquo;s Travel Show was looking for people
to interview! I got in touch with someone from the BBC, and was scheduled for an interview the next
day.</p>

<p>The next day I spent the morning doing laundry, and then walked over to the BBC for the interview (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0232gkn">the clip is online now</a>).
The camera man was a really cool dude named James Allen. He said he enjoyed the interview
because it was a break from more monotonous stuff he was doing earlier in the day (filming people cooking). Of course
I had to talk about my CBC experience with him and he revealed that he&rsquo;s in a band! They are called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIndPO4OqE">Mummy Short Arms</a>, which is so fitting given the pun I posted on Facebook the day before! After the
interview and lots of walking, I met up with a bunch of ThoughtWorkers for dinner. It became very
clear to me that evening that I miss ThoughtWorkers a lot, but ThoughtWorks not as much.</p>

<h3>Edinburgh</h3>

<p>My last day was spent on a day trip to Edinburgh. People have always said that it&rsquo;s a beautiful city and
they are right. It was more beautiful than I expected and spent the day taking a couple tours. A big
thank you to Rose for telling me about <a href="http://www.neweuropetours.eu/">Sandeman</a> tours. I did the following:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/edinburgh-free-tour.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/edinburgh-free-tour.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newedinburghtours.com/daily-tours/new-edinburgh-free-tour.html">Free Tour</a>: After this first tour, I was hooked on this style. The guides were young and
full of enthusiasm. My picture of a guided tour was of a slow moving parade of old people getting bombarded
with facts and dates. This tour group does a great job of keeping the energy up. One thing I observed was how focused
the audience got when the guide mentioned that something was a feature or inspiration for a movie, myself included.
It&rsquo;s interesting how pop culture somehow makes things more relevant to your mind.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newedinburghtours.com/daily-tours/castle-tour-edinburgh.html">Castle Tour</a>: Since I liked the free tour so much, I decided to do the castle tour. The guide
was a <a href="http://www.newedinburghtours.com/our-guides/billy.html">charismatic Scotsman</a> and told a story about the castle and Edinburgh in such a way that you could transport
yourself to that era.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was sad to leave Scotland because it&rsquo;s such a friendly place. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s also expensive,
although I guess it&rsquo;s cheaper than London, but that&rsquo;s not saying much.</p>

<h3>Berlin</h3>

<p>I had to wake up at 3:30am to begin my trip to Berlin! The interary was a bit complex: Glasgow &ndash;> London &ndash;> Brussels
&ndash;> Koln &ndash;> Berlin. Here I was going to stay with an ex-ThoughtWorker, <a href="https://twitter.com/pcalcado">Phil Calcado</a>. The interesting
thing about Phil is that I barely know him! I had a couple beers with him
the year before, but he happily hosted me in his awesome flat for several days. I eventually made it to
his place at around 11:00pm (I didn&rsquo;t quite navigate the Berlin metro optimally that evening). There
was a little <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> gathering going on and another ex-ThoughtWorker, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomczarniecki">Tom Czarniecki</a>, was
there too! It seems the world has ThoughtWorks affiliates everywhere.</p>

<p>It appears I timed things well as I got to be in Germany for the world cup final! Myself and Phil went
down to <a href="http://www.pratergarten.de/d/">Prater Biergarten</a>. Tom joined us a bit later. Then for some odd reason, I got interviewed by
a Mexican journalist. I&rsquo;m not making it up, because Phil and Tom will vouch for me. The whole city turned
into a party and we stayed out til around 4:00am. I still can&rsquo;t get the Uber Deuchstland song out of my head.</p>

<p>Like in Edinburgh, Sandeman does tours in Berlin. I did these three:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/potsdam-tour.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/potsdam-tour.small.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newberlintours.com/daily-tours/free-tour.html">Free Tour</a>: Like in Edinburgh, the guide was passionate and energetic. It was fascinating to
see the Jewish memorial, and place related to the war.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newberlintours.com/daily-tours/potsdam-city-of-emperors.html">Potsdam</a>: I was craving something different and this tour looked to offer that. I got the same
guide as the day before. I didn&rsquo;t know a single thing about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia">Prussian empire</a> before and this tour made me start
reading tons of Wikipedia articles about it. My favourite part of this tour was wandering the gardens created by
emperors, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanssouci_Park">Sanssouci Park</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newberlintours.com/daily-tours/sachsenhausen-memorial.html">Sauchsenhausen</a>: I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect in a tour of a concentration camp. The
guide impressed me by how he approached the subject matter. I&rsquo;m glad I saw the camp, even
though it can&rsquo;t really be described as a pleasant tour. It&rsquo;s a reminder that normal people can do terrible things.</li>
</ul>


<p>Before I left I had one more evening of beers with yet another <a href="https://twitter.com/dtemme">ex-ThoughtWorker</a>, Daniel Temme!</p>

<h3>Heidelberg</h3>

<p>Travel from Berlin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a> was a direct train. I made my way to my <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2337045">airbnb</a>
and got settled for spending some time in this beautiful town. I purposely planned to have a free day before the F1. I wandered throughout
the old town and the castle. My favourite thing about this part of the trip are the picnics I had; the top one being
on a bench in Philospher&rsquo;s Way. The weather was so hot that I didn&rsquo;t really want to stay inside a restaurant, nor a
patio. It was really nice to simply purchase some groceries and wander around looking for a nice spot in the town to
eat.</p>

<h3>German Grand Prix</h3>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/hockenheim-podium.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/career-break/hockenheim-podium.small.jpg" width="300"></a>
Getting to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockenheim">Hockenheim</a> was pretty straighforward. There&rsquo;s a bus from the train station, or I can take a
train with a single connection in Manheim. The race weekend was super hot with the air temperature around
35C and they said the track temperature was around 55C! I need to learn what exactly track temperature
means, but I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s how hot it is in you&rsquo;re sitting in the sun.</p>

<p>So far this race is where I&rsquo;ve had the best seats. I was amazing to actually see the cars start the race
and watch them go through the first turn. It was scary to see Massa&rsquo;s car flip during the start of the race but
was relieved to see him walk out of the car. The picture here is a first for me; I actually made it to the podium area for
the awards ceremony!</p>
