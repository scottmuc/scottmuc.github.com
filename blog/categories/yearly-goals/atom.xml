<h2>Reflections on <a href="/my-resolutions-for-2016/">2016</a></h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Write in a Journal</strong> &ndash; This one I am marking as a success.  Here are the (manually) calculated stats:</li>

<p>I wrote <strong>143</strong> journal entries over the course of 2016.  After counting them all up there are far fewer than I thought,
but the frequency is actually more consistent than I thought. I had imagined I had more months that only had a couple
entries. I see this as my first step in writing more and hopefully bringing it to this website. Seeing that my
journalling actually increased by the end of the year makes me really happy. I&rsquo;m going to continue this in 2017 for
sure.</p>

<h2>Goal for 2017:</h2>

<p>In the spirit of keeping my goal(s) simple and achievable I&rsquo;m going to stick to a similar strategy as 2016.</p>

<h3>Perform 1 Perfect Pullup</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s been many years since I&rsquo;ve been able to do a pullup. My body finally feels recovered from my previous injuries, but
it&rsquo;s certainly weaker than it&rsquo;s ever been. My <a href="/health/">health dashboard</a> has already helped me reach a gym
going habit, but now I need to direct this routine to a different end. I cannot do the physical things I used to because
I&rsquo;ve gotten so out of shape and my previous focus on running put too much pressure on my weak body.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>As I grow older, the length of a year seems much shorter. I wonder if my previous <a href="/blog/categories/yearly-goals/">goals</a> were a result of not
acknowledging how much I can possibly do in that time frame.</p>

    <id>http://scottmuc.com/my-resolutions-for-2016</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post almost didn&rsquo;t happen. 2015 holds a lot of dead-air from me in the blogging world, but I&rsquo;m so compelled by my
routines that I felt that I had to do it! Honouring a self-made routine/tradition is my achilles heel and my biggest
strength at the same time.</p>

<h2>Reflections on <a href="/my-resolutions-for-2015/">2015</a></h2>

<p>2015 wasn&rsquo;t a good year for sticking to my goals, but I still learned a lot on the way:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Brew Beer</strong> &ndash; Didn&rsquo;t do well here since I didn&rsquo;t brew a single batch, but there was a lot of taste testing!</li>
<li><strong>Nurture a Healthy Habit</strong> &ndash; The year was off to a great start until I injured my leg. I attempted to get back into
running a bit too strong and injured myself again. If there&rsquo;s something positive I can take from this though is
that I still wish to run. It&rsquo;s been a very frustrating year as a result because I missed running in Berlin during
the best time of the year! I ended up gaining weight, which made me not feel so good about myself and other healthy
habits collapsed as well. The good news is that the desire is still there and I just need get back slowly.</li>
<li><strong>Think More Critically</strong> &ndash; This one is a strange one because I don&rsquo;t have anything countable to associate with it. In the
end I feel more clueless about everything. As I put a critical focus on anything it opens up complexity that I had
never imagined. Now I&rsquo;m not sure how people are so sure about anything! I need to stop listening to so many economics
podcasts ;&ndash;).</li>
</ul>


<p>That being said, I kicked arse on a <a href="/my-developer-resolutions-for-2014/">2014 resolution</a> which was to learn <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>! Docker is a core
piece of technology in what I was working on at <a href="/joining-soundcloud-and-moving-to-berlin/">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

<p>Looking back, 2015 was a difficult year to make such goals. I&rsquo;ve found a lot of interesting tactics on
<a href="http://jamesclear.com/good-habits">James Clear&rsquo;s article about good habits</a>. How would things been different had I set the goal to 1 run
per month? Even with my injury I&rsquo;m sure I would have been more proactive in testing the waters with a single 3k run each month.
Also, why not make the beer brewing goal a single brew for the entire year? I held back on brewing because I was
intimidated by the equipment I would have had to purchase and store. If it was one brew, I would have simply
brewed with the few people that I&rsquo;ve met in Berlin that do home brewing. Then again, it&rsquo;s easy to say that
in retrospect.</p>

<h2>Goal for 2016:</h2>

<p>This year I&rsquo;m going on a bit of a tangent from previous years. I feel I pushed 2015 too hard. It was more work than I
had anticipated. A good challenge but I set my expectations too high. 2016 is likely to be similar with moving to a new
city and starting a new job (post on that coming later this month). So I&rsquo;m only going to make 1 goal. I see it as a
realigning goal, a course correction from the journey that started when I left <a href="/leaving-a-dream-job-and-going-on-an-adventure/">ThoughtWorks back in 2014</a>.</p>

<h3>Write in a Journal</h3>

<p>I have the urge to write, but the public forum doesn&rsquo;t feel right. A real physical book where my text doesn&rsquo;t flow
through prying eyes wanting to find patterns, so that they can serve me better ads. I&rsquo;ve been
fairly public with my life and I&rsquo;m curious about taking that down a notch. My head feels like a swirling mass of
ideas that hasn&rsquo;t quite found its outlet (though those who have been out drinking with me when the topic of
economics comes up, would beg to differ).</p>

<p>Think of it as close-sourcing my thoughts. Once public, it&rsquo;s hard to make things private, but the other way is
certainly possible.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>A bit of a change from the usual. Let&rsquo;s see how things are in a year, shall we?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This has become a bit of a tradition for me so I can&rsquo;t quite writing these now. This one will be a bit different than
the previous ones though. Normally these posts are my <em>technical</em> resolutions. I&rsquo;m not that ambitious anymore when it
comes to technical learning so I&rsquo;ve dropped that from the title. Even though I tend to despise meaningless dates, I look
at resolutions as one large <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro</a>. So the tradition lives on!</p>

<h2>Reflections on <a href="/my-developer-resolutions-for-2014/">2014</a></h2>

<p>Going on a <a href="/blog/categories/career-break/">career break</a> sort of twisted everything around in 2014. Still, it was interesting to see how
I did:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase Signal to Noise Ration &ndash; I&rsquo;m only following 118 people on Twitter now as opposed to 627, but my &ldquo;friend&rdquo;
count on FaceBook went up to 507 from 480. Considering that Twitter is where most of the noise comes from, I think I
succeeded in this goal.</li>
<li>Learn Docker &ndash; I&rsquo;ve yet to run the docker CLI, so didn&rsquo;t go far with this. I&rsquo;m not terribly interested in it now as my
frustration with tech is still there. 2015 may be a success if I still don&rsquo;t touch docker.</li>
<li>Do Meaningful Work &ndash; Does quitting my job and traveling the world for 9 months count as success? It does to me so I
think I slayed this resolution! I&rsquo;m also getting back into the <a href="/joining-soundcloud-and-moving-to-berlin/">workforce</a> with a company that is in a domain I care
about and I&rsquo;ve gotten the opportunity to be on the board of advisors for an interesting <a href="http://zolair-energy.com/">clean energy start up</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Goals for 2015:</h2>

<p>I think the time off has given me a new perspective. These goals are more about looking at myself externally and
figuring out what kind of design changes to I want to make on myself.</p>

<h3>Brew Beer</h3>

<p>Given that I want to look into the business of beer, it would help if I&rsquo;ve actually brewed some. I believe brewing 10
batches is a reasonable goal. If I can&rsquo;t do this, then I can safely drop the idea of building a beer related business in
the future. I enjoy publishing my <a href="https://twitter.com/todayschai">chai</a> experiments and I&rsquo;ll do the same thing with my beer brewing. Will
probably publish them on this blog for now.</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>: 0 batches brewed</p>

<h3>Nurture a Healthy Habit</h3>

<p>Over the last 15 years of my life I&rsquo;ve ridden a health rollercoaster. I can&rsquo;t recall any year where I didn&rsquo;t go
off the routine and regress to my old unhealthy habits. This year I&rsquo;m aiming to be more proactive around my habits and
plan a bit better when I can see potential for a habit to break (eg: when traveling, or a busy period). My goal is run
at least 10 times every month. Be sure to verify my results on <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/6575733">Strava</a>. I am training for a half marathon but
this is very typical of my health ambitions. Do something big, and then stop.</p>

<p><strong>January</strong>: 19 runs<br/>
<strong>February</strong>: 13 runs<br/>
<strong>March</strong>: 6 runs (strained hamstring injury)<br/>
<strong>April</strong>:<br/>
<strong>May</strong>:<br/>
<strong>June</strong>:<br/>
<strong>July</strong>:<br/>
<strong>August</strong>:<br/>
<strong>September</strong>:<br/>
<strong>October</strong>:<br/>
<strong>November</strong>:<br/>
<strong>December</strong>:<br/></p>

<h3>Think More Critically</h3>

<p>This could be due to having a lot of time to consume too much media over the last year, but I feel that I should be more
thoughtful in my communication and critical of my messages. It&rsquo;s easy to type out a pithy tweet skipping a load of
context. When being critical I will do due dilligence in citing research when trying to impose my ideas, or at least be
more transparent in pointing out how much is anecdotal. This one is a tougher one to measure. The only thing I can think
of is comparing the number of tweets over the course of the years, and having source lists in all my blog posts (or
stating the source are my own observations and are completely theoretical).</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>When reading my <a href="/my-developer-resolutions-for-2014/">2014 post</a> I can tell that I was getting jaded about the IT industry. It looks like I&rsquo;m still a bit
jaded, but this time I&rsquo;m steering the ship away from IT a bit. Let&rsquo;s see what these new waters are like.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was tempted to not write this post. My motivations are changing a bit and growing strong technically isn&rsquo;t one of
my top priorities nowadays.</p>

<h2>Reflections on <a href="/my-developer-resolutions-for-2013/">2013</a></h2>

<p>Last year was very interesting for me. It&rsquo;s the first time I didn&rsquo;t really have a home. I&rsquo;ve split my time between
India, United States, and South Africa, (ok, I was in Toronto for a few weeks too). During that time I&rsquo;ve reflected a
lot (probably too much). My work was split between training new software developers and developing tools to deploy
the largest and most complex distributed system I&rsquo;ve ever worked on.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s look back at 2013 and see how I did with my resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read 7 Languages in 7 Weeks &ndash; This was a massive fail. I never even got past chapter 1!</li>
<li>More Presentations &ndash; I would give myself a passing grade here. I&rsquo;ve started doing more internal presentations, but
I&rsquo;m sure that there&rsquo;s expectation for me to do more. The problem here is that I really don&rsquo;t enjoy delivering
presentations, but I do struggle when I believe I have interesting things to say and they&rsquo;re stuck in my head. I
definitely need an outlet and will have to figure this out going forward.</li>
<li>Expand my Ops Toolbelt &ndash; This one was definitely a success. I&rsquo;ve picked up Puppet, Ansible and MCollective. Also, I
feel that I&rsquo;ve grown quite adept at Continuous Delivery pipelines and Vagrantizing development environments.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Development Goals for 2014:</h2>

<p>2014 is going to be a different year for me. I don&rsquo;t really care about goals as much, but want to build better habits. I&rsquo;ve reached
many of my goals only to regress behaviour after the goals have been achieved. I&rsquo;ve realized that many of my technical
goals were due more to my ego and fear of looking dumb in front of colleagues and clients. I&rsquo;ve realized that I actually
have a pretty good personal brand, and that people respect my abilities. I&rsquo;ve proven myself over and over again, and
it&rsquo;s time for me to believe it myself.</p>

<h3>Increase Signal to Noise Ratio</h3>

<p>Social media tax is too high for me right now. It&rsquo;s time to start culling the amount of inputs I have. At least I&rsquo;ve
deleted my LinkedIn account. I&rsquo;m going to have a daily unfriend/unfollow 1 person, until I feel things are a bit more
manageable. One small victory in 2013 was deleting my LinkedIn account.</p>

<p>Improving my e-mail habits are up there as well. Things like not checking my e-mail before work is a habit that I plan
on picking up. I also need to write less e-mails. E-mails beget more e-mail.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Friends at end of 2013</strong> == 480</li>
<li><strong>Following on Twitter at of 2013</strong> == 627</li>
</ul>


<h3>Learn Docker</h3>

<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll sneak in a technical goal. I want to simply understand what the hype is around <a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>. I tend to be very slow
to catch onto trends. There&rsquo;s enough hype around Docker that I think I should at least understand what I&rsquo;m missing if I
do miss that boat.</p>

<h3>Do Meaningful Work</h3>

<p>4 years ago I left <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/">CBC</a> for <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. I don&rsquo;t regret the decision at all, but I now understand what it&rsquo;s like to do
meaningful work. Working on <a href="http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2009/12/Today-on-Lanarama-Techie-Tuesday-A-Fond-Farewell-to-Scott-Muc">Radio 3</a> was fulfilling work, and I&rsquo;m still proud of what was created, and have strong
connections with the people I worked with there.</p>

<p>The tough part about the consulting business is that you can potentially work for money hungry
organisations. I personally don&rsquo;t want to help retail vendors sell more shirts, or banks earn more interest.
ThoughtWorks does do a lot of meaningful work, and I&rsquo;m going to do something I find more fulfilling. Another
stint in India doing ThoughtWorks University would be something that would satisfying this need.</p>

<p>Being a competent developer, I think I owe it to society to do what I can for a greater good. So I&rsquo;m looking at
contributing to <a href="http://www.mailpile.is/">MailPile</a> as a first step. The open government space is something I would like to explore as
well.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I think 2013 was a bit of a downer because of what&rsquo;s been revealed by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/1">Edward Snowden</a>. The numerous large scale
<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/12/31/3108661/10-biggest-privacy-security-breaches-rocked-2013/">theft of e-mail addresses and passwords</a> have also lowered confidence in IT as a whole. Let&rsquo;s not talk about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/20/4859316/healthcare-gov-woes">Obama Care</a>.
It&rsquo;s frustating to see the industry that I love so much do so much harm, and become so untrustworthy.
2014 is going to shape to be an interesting year as a result of these events.</p>

    <updated>2012-12-31T10:45:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://scottmuc.com/my-developer-resolutions-for-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2012 started off interesting because I was on on an iOS/ruby project. Nearly everything was new to me, but I liked how
my past experiences with other technology stacks were still relevant. Even though I didn&rsquo;t know the languages very well
the patterns I&rsquo;ve seen before still applied.</p>

<p>The last quarter of the year was spent teaching new software developers in India, which has been one of the most
rewarding experiences of my career! It has definitely influenced my goals for 2013.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Reflections on 2012 and carry over from 2011:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn a server provisioning automation tool (2011) &ndash; I may have failed this one big time in 2011 but 2012 was a great
year for this. I spent much of the year getting to know Chef. I feel I can check this one off now.</li>
<li>Stop reading comments (2012) &ndash; Can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve stopped reading comments but I&rsquo;m more conscious of when I&rsquo;m wasting my
time and tend to stop immediately. I started following a <a href="https://twitter.com/AvoidComments">useful twitter account</a>
which provides constant reminders that reading comments can be a huge waste of time.</li>
<li>No client work when away from client (2012) &ndash; I twisted this one into a conditional success. I still like to hack in
my spare time but I hack on my personal projects and stay away from doing extra billable hours when I should be having
ME time. I&rsquo;ve been much better at saying NO to excess outings and have focused on being healthy.</li>
<li>Complete <a href="https://github.com/manojlds/YDeliver/">YDeliver</a> (2012) &ndash; This one is a big failure. I barely touched
YDeliver all year. Apparently it&rsquo;s been used in a few ThoughtWorks projects by <a href="https://github.com/manojlds">Manoj</a> and he now
has ownership of the repository. I&rsquo;ve come to the realization that OSS doesn&rsquo;t come out of a vacuum. YDeliver was
going strong when I still had fresh memories of that previous project, but as time went on, the relevance (to me) of
YDeliver was diminishing. The takeaway for is me to maintain the momentum if it&rsquo;s there.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Development Goals for 2013:</h2>

<p>While 2012 was a great mix of fun ops tooling learning and consulting, I want to get back to my roots (pun?) and do more low
level tech related things. At the same time, I want to improve on my teaching skills which will mean facilitating more learning
workshops and presenting more frequently.</p>

<h3>Read <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">7 Languages in 7 Weeks</a></h3>

<p>Much of my effort is spent making many puzzle pieces fit together. Being isolated to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> and a text editor would be
pleasant change. Also, I haven&rsquo;t dived deep into a language lately. All my ruby learning has been simply by having to
write ruby code for work. I can&rsquo;t say I know the language, but I&rsquo;ve managed to figure things out. I miss having a little
bit deeper knowledge of a language like I used to have with C#.</p>

<p>My action plan is to purchase the book and do 1 language a month. So by July this goal will be accomplished.</p>

<h3>More Presentations</h3>

<p>Being a trainer at ThoughtWorks University taught me that I have a lot to learn about presenting. <a href="http://www.learninggeneralist.com/">Sumeet
Moghe</a>, who was the previous lead trainer, showed excellent examples of what makes a
good presentation. It was interesting, because I always felt those points internally, but he expresses them externally
in a digestable way that actually inspires me to make excellent presentations.</p>

<p>My colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/tpbrown">Tim Brown</a> will be happy about this goal because he&rsquo;s been nagging me for a
while about this. Some topics I&rsquo;ve been pondering so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to provide local infrastructure (aka never install a DB server on your machine again)</li>
<li>Application configuration patterns with a non-trivial number of environments</li>
<li>PowerShell BDD with <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester/">Pester</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The action plan is to choose 1 of these topics and present it 3 times. As well as the presentations, I will design 3
different workshops and faciliate each one 3 times.</p>

<h3>Expand my Ops Toolbelt</h3>

<p>I really love ops and I think this is the career path I want to continue on. 2012 was great for learning
<a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>, so this year I want to learn <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>. Another area
that I would like to improve upon my knowledge is the domain of remoting.</p>

<p>My action plan is to duplicate any Vagrant server setups that use Chef to use Puppet as well. This will be great for
a side-by-side comparison. So currently that would mean the following repositories need a puppet provisioner:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/vagrant-postgresql">vagrant-postgresql</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/vagrant_rails">vagrant-rails</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/gordon">gordon</a></li>
</ul>


<p>For remoting I plan on writing 10 blog posts on tools like ssh, winRM. I want to dive into the mechanics of
authentication and networking to better understand technologies like kerberos, certificates, and gssapi which are
crucial for making remoting work on a larger scale.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The last few years I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about managing my goals. I&rsquo;m doing my best to keep my goals
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> so that I can actually achieve them. We&rsquo;ll see how things turn
out 365 days from now!</p>
