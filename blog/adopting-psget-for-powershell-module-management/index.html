			<h1>Adopting PsGet for PowerShell Module Management</h1>
			<div>
				<p>For a while now I&rsquo;ve been waiting for something that can be as close to ruby gems as possible for PowerShell. For a while I thought Nuget was the way but it&rsquo;s tight coupling to Visual Studio made it feel like it wasn&rsquo;t quite the right fit for PowerShell.</p>
<p>Mike Chaliy has made probably what could be called the simplest thing that could possibly work, and it works well! It&rsquo;s called PsGet (not to be confused with another project called PsGet). Take a look at the homepage and bask in its simplicity! Installation is copying/pasting the bootstrap code. Then install modules via name or absolute url to a powershell module.</p>
<p>Take a look at my post about Pester for an example of setting it up.</p>
<p>I have a couple features that I would like to bake into it. Hopefully I won&rsquo;t add too much complexity to it as I do really appreciate it&rsquo;s simple approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deploy a specific version (using git tags) eg: <a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/Pester/archives/1.0.3">https://github.com/scottmuc/Pester/archives/1.0.3</a></li>
<li>Something similar to the concept of gemsets in rvm for easy switching between module versions</li>
</ul>
