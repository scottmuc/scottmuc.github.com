			<h1>My Goals for 2021</h1>

				<h2 id="reflections-on-2020-and-earlier">Reflections on 2020 and Earlier</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recall exactly why I didn&rsquo;t bother write a goal post (pun?) last year, but let&rsquo;s ignore that for now. I&rsquo;m back
in action! Let&rsquo;s start with some reflections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Berlin has now been my home for 3 years. This is the longest I&rsquo;ve lived somewhere outside of my home city since
<a href="/blog/a-new-beginning-or-goodbye-20-s-hello-30-s/">Calgary</a> (over 11 years ago)! I&rsquo;m loving my home and my life here so I don&rsquo;t see myself moving again
anytime soon. Here&rsquo;s a view of my happy place in my flat (Meine Wohnung).</p>

<p>I managed to do start some initiatives related to my <a href="/my-resolutions-for-2019/">2019 goal</a> around game streaming!. My videos have
been vieed 377 times and watched for 71hrs. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdY9IPS1jPwLpHwPL3KnLlPi9GpkAKXyP">Soul Level 1 Dark Souls play through</a> is by far my favourite. It&rsquo;s
really a shame I lost episode 1 on Twitch. I learned that doing these streams and videos does take a lot of time and
energy and doing it while working full time is not feasible for me (I did these videos during a couple months break
from work).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Journal entries: 27 - I found myself writing in my journal a lot less in 2020. This is not something I want to abandon
this year. Reading my previous entries has been valuable to me. That being said, I&rsquo;ve probably written more words in
2020 than previous years, they just aren&rsquo;t publically accessible. My internal work journal probably has more than 27
entries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goals-for-2021">Goals for 2021:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Permanent Residence</strong> - Given how much I gush about living here, you would think I&rsquo;m a permanent resident? Nope, my
residency here depends on my work permit. I want to break this coupling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Winding Down Work</strong> - I&rsquo;m reaching a point where I would prefer to have more time in my life than money. Success
will be reducing my hours somehow (most preferrably working 4 days a week). This is primarily for obligitaory employed
work. I know I&rsquo;ll never stop working :-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cycling Initiative</strong> - I bought a bike this year, and given that all things are pointing to me sticking around
Berlin, I&rsquo;m not as concerned about have to either sell it or transport it. I&rsquo;ve been dealing with all sorts of
different pains in my legs/knees/back ever since I injured myself training for a half marathon in 2015. Riding a bike
has been the best activity for me. Even walking long distances hasn&rsquo;t been good. I want to incorporate bicycling with
how I travel and experience Germany. I have a MASSIVE goal around biking to Luxembourg for a wedding.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Launch Personal Finance Site</strong> - The first two goals wouldn&rsquo;t have seemed feasible to me but the way I&rsquo;ve been
managing my money has opened them up to me. At the moment there&rsquo;s a skeleton of a website for a project that I&rsquo;ve
called <a href="https://www.goodenoughmoney.com/">Good Enough Money</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to shaking things up a bit. My appetite for risk and adventure is back. Funny how in my last update
I mention my travel hunger is satiated. That&rsquo;s certainly turning around now.</p>
