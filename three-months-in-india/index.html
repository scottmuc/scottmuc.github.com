<div class="entry-content"><p><em>September 20th &ndash; December 16th</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/career-break/blr-lake.large.jpg" width="800"></p>

<p>Ugh, I left this post until way too late. Unfortunately I&rsquo;ll have to drop a lot of detail as 3 months is pretty hard to
sum up in a single blog post. Hopefully I can do it justice as India is a place I&rsquo;m very fond of. I feel bad for all the
wonderful little experiences that happened and didn&rsquo;t get written about. I&rsquo;ll just have to visit India again and
properly journal the whole experience.</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>

<p><a href="/images/blog/career-break/blr-flood.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/career-break/blr-flood.medium.jpg" width="200"></a>
The minute I got off the plane I was greeted with the familiar scent of Bangalore. The city gives me a bizarre sense of
being home. My arrival to India this time around is much different than the paniced call to Calgary at 4am where my
arrange pickup wasn&rsquo;t there. This time I breezed through the crowd to the taxi line and made my way to Indiranagar where
I was to stay in a wonderful <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/1009953">guest house</a> for the next long while.</p>

<p>It was the end of monsoon season and there was a bit more rain than last time. It was quite refreshing because it kept
the air clean for a little while. There was one evening where the road leading up to my apartment was flooded and had to
wade through knee deep &ldquo;water&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Work Life Balance</h3>

<p>My goal in India was to finish my job search and just chill out for a little while. But first, I had to find a place
where I could hang out for most of the day to use the Internet. I first tried <a href="http://www.cobaltblr.com/">Cobalt</a> which was on Church St,
just a few minutes away from MG Road metro station. It had good Internet and there were other people around that made it
feel nice. The next day I tried <a href="http://www.beaglesloft.com/">Beaglesloft</a> as it was started by an ex-ThoughtWorker. It was a short walk from Trinity metro station, and it was decent too. A bit too quiet though.</p>

<h3>Finding Nilenso</h3>

<p>There was one more place to check out. An ex-ThoughtWorker, <a href="https://twitter.com/deobald">Steve</a> from Calgary, has lived in Bangalore for a
while and has is part of a software collective called <a href="http://nilenso.com/">Nilenso</a>. I also recommend reading his
<a href="http://blog.deobald.ca/">blog</a> as he is an excellent writer and has written some very insightful posts about life.</p>

<p>After one day of hanging out with the folks at Nilenso I had realized I had found my home. The whole group was extremely
welcoming to me. I had met Steve once before (for like around 5 minutes) and didn&rsquo;t know the others yet I now consider
them friends and will visit them every time I go back to Bangalore. They set me up with good Internet, a workstation
setup and meals! It was really hard not to apply and work with them. They also were excellent test subjects for my
<a href="https://twitter.com/todayschai">chai experiments</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/career-break/blr-chai.large.jpg" width="800"></p>

<h3>Pune</h3>

<p>After a few weeks I scheduled a trip to Pune to see some old friends and meet a company for a job interview. I had
Internet issues at the place I was staying at so I had to go to Starbucks nearly everyday for interviews and other
correspondance.</p>

<p>The job interview went really well, but declined to pursue the job any further as it felt like it would be ThoughtWorks
part 2. I used the down time to write a couple blog posts and do a little cooking.</p>

<h3>Chennai</h3>

<p>I wanted to meet some friends in Chennai as well so I did another short outing to see them. Besides eating awesome South
Indian food all day long I collaborated with <a href="https://twitter.com/rdsubhas">Subhas Dandapani</a> on <a href="http://www.devopsbookmarks.com/">devopsbookmarks.com</a>. All I
really did was &ldquo;project manage&rdquo; and Subhas essentially did all the work.</p>

<h3>Beer Tour</h3>

<p>Bangalore has a beer scene that&rsquo;s growing strong. In this trip alone I was able to visit 10 brewpubs and that&rsquo;s not
hitting them all!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://toit.in/">Toit</a> &ndash; Definitely one of my favourites. I think I went there at least once a week. I highly recommend their
weiss beer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.murphysbrewhouse.in/">Murphy&rsquo;s</a> &ndash; Only went their once for lunch. None of their beers really stood out to me. I regret not going
again because the view is quite nice.</li>
<li><a href="http://windmillscraftworks.com/">Windmills</a> &ndash; Overall, I think Windmills makes the best beer in Bangalore. It&rsquo;s a bit of a trek because
it&rsquo;s all the way in Whitefield.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.barleyz.com/">Barleyz</a> &ndash; The beer isn&rsquo;t that great, but the rooftop terrace is a good reason to go there. All the beers
tasted too watery.</li>
<li><a href="http://thebiereclub.com/">Biere Club</a> &ndash; A decent spot with decent beers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.arborbrewing.com/locations/india/">Arbor</a> &ndash; Arbor always shows up as the place to go for the best beer in Bangalore. I do think the beer is ok,
but it&rsquo;s not even close to Windmills in quality. I also found their beer gave me an allergic reaction. The beer is not
filtered and I know sometimes that can affect me, but it was more pronounced there.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/VapourBangalore">Vapour</a> &ndash; I ignored this spot for a while due to people around me saying it wasn&rsquo;t very good. While not all
beers were of consistent quality, the red ale was pretty good and their weiss beer was decent too. It&rsquo;s also a nice
roof top patio that serves decent food.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bigpitcher">Big Pitcher</a> &ndash; A giant establishment. Only checked it out once. There were a couple decent beers, but
the others tasted really off.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.brewsky.in/">Brewsky</a> &ndash; Best IPA I&rsquo;ve had in India. The dunkel was also really good, but the rest were quite bad.</li>
<li><a href="http://prost.in/">Prost</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve heard mixed reviews about the beers, but I found them to be pretty good. The Big Ben ale reminds
me a lot of the English Bay Pale Ale, which is an old favourite of mine. Their stout is quite good too, which is a
beer that doesn&rsquo;t seem to get much love in other Bangalore pubs.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Pun Town</h3>

<p>One of the reasons why Bangalore is close to my heart has to be their love of puns. Here are some of the stores that
were within 1km of where I was staying:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blind Love</li>
<li>Berry&#8217;ed Alive</li>
<li>Phobidden Fruit</li>
<li>Wearhouse</li>
<li>Infinitea</li>
<li>Chaipatty</li>
</ul>


<h3>Oh, and I Got a Job!</h3>

<p>Over the course of a few months I had interviewed with several companies. It was interesting trying to manage all of
this while moving around and being in terribly inconvenient time zones. I&rsquo;ve already <a href="/joining-soundcloud-and-moving-to-berlin/">written</a> and huge post
about the job hunt process. Now I have a blog that if read in order really doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>All and all, this trip to India is a very stark contrast compared to my previous visit. I didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot of
traveling. It was really a low-key retreat so that I could do lots of reading, podcast listening, computering, and
reflecting. Sort of makes me wish I wrote about my previous trip because that one was definitely a lot more things going
on, but this trip was exactly what I needed/wanted.</p>
